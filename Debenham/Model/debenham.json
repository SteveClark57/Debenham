        "term": "-a",
        "meaning": "A suffix with several uses, e.g. in such latin nouns as alga, Gemma, and latinised nouns as cypsela (from Greek kypsele), the suffix indicates singular number, feminine gender.  When the plural of such nouns is intended, -ae substitutes for -a (hence algae, gamma, cypselae).  When forming the plural of a noun suffixed by -a but of direct origin from the Greek (e.g. chromonema, sterigma, stone), -ata is often the substituting suffix (hence chromonemata, sterigmata, stomata).\n\nFor nouns suffixed by -um to indicate neuter gender, singular number (e.g. bacterium, flagellum, sporangium), a substituted -a forms the plural (hence bacteria, flagella, sporangia). For the nomenclature of taxonomic groups at the levels of division and class, the name-endings recommended by the International Code are phyta and -opsida (e.g. Division Pteridophyta, Class Pter(id)opsida of conservative classifications), the names being treated as neuter plural.\n\nAs an ending to a generic name (a noun in singular number) and a specific epithet (an adjective qualifying the noun) when in agreement in gender, a indicates the feminine, e.g. Angophora costata."

When more than one hydroxyl group are concerned, the alcohol may be dihydric (the glycols), or trihydric (e.g. glycerol or glycerine C₃H₅(OH)₂) or polyhydric.

        "term": "Alga",
        "meaning": "(plural algae) a plant which, although rarely differentiated to specialised organs and is in exchange with the environment by superficial diffusion of solutes and gases through unlocalised regions, utilises the energy from sunlight to a greater degree (especially as a component of pelagic plankton) and higher efficiency than the terrestrial plant, and has a physiology in most respects not fundamentally different from plants of higher organisation. Its structure varies from a simple microscopic cell to the complexity of a higher seaweed\n\nIn addition to light-fixing chloroplasts, other plastids, chromatophores, usually provide accessory photosynthetic pigments, the colour often masking the green of chlorophyll. The accessory pigment is either a water-soluble, strongly fluorescent proteinaceous compound, phycobilin, or a carotenoid (q.v.) of an orange or yellow colour. Phycobilins include such pigments as the blue phycocyanin and the rose-red or violet-red phycoerythrin. The pigmentation is a heritable character, fixed early in evolution and possibly deidined by the amount of light energy available to the ancestor at the time; it provides a most useful basis for classification\n\nBlue-green algae: mostly epiphytic plants of soil, fresh water, or seas (e.g. Nostoc and Anabaena of nitrogen-fixation, fresh water plankton, and 'water-bloom'). When unicellular, may be solitary or form filamentous or plate-like colonies, and when multicellular usually forms filaments composed of ensheathed cells (trichomes). In addition to chlorophyll-a and certain carotenoids, the accessory pigment usually is phycocyanin but this may occur also with phycoerythrin, or the latter may occur alone; such pigments never are confined in chromatophores. The 'blue-greens' have certain features of some bacterial groups e.g. a primitive nucleus, reproduction by amitotic cell division, food reserve a starch-like glycogen, enclosure of cells in a gelatinous sheath. In common also is the ability of certain members to reduce atmospheric nitrogen and to withstand temperatures intolerant to most other organisms.\n\nIn recent classificatory schemes, the position of the blue-green algae (as a class Cyanophyceae) is with the bacteria to form a division (Schizophyta). Among algae they are unique in the absence of a highly organised nucleus.\n\nRed algae: in common with the 'blue-greens', the red algae have phycobilins as the pigments accessory to chlorophylls (the chlorophylls are a and d). usually phycoerythrin alone, less frequently phycocyanin with or alone, store a starch (floridean starch) chemically related to glycogen, and are without motile cells. Unlike them, most red algae are sexually reproductive and the pigments are alwavs localised in chromatophores. Life cycles often are complex and unique (e.g. Polysiphonia, Nemalion), with a regular alternation of generations, the generations being almost identical: dioecism also is frequent. Essentially deep water members of tropical to polar seas, predominant of the seaweeds in Australian waters (see also nullipore), some are littoral or above high tide limit where they attach to rocks by disc-like 'hold fasts' or systems of hair-like rhizoids, while others are of fresh water (e.g. Batrachospermum). Fewer again are terrestrial, some of these endozoic. Many are epiphytic (e.g. on kelps) or epizoic (e.g. on hydroids). They range from microscopic and unicellular up to about 2 metres in length, the structure typically a multicellular thallus which may be a simple filament or (more usual) a frond flat or cylindrical, sometimes branched and shrub-like with a stem-like stipe.  As sources of polysaccharides (phycocolloids) are of high economic interest. Phvcocolloids disperse in water to form colloidal systems of use as emulsifying, gelling, and thickening agents. Chieflv Gelidium and Gracilaria spp. for agar, the well known biological culture medium, Chondrus crispus (Irish Moss) and Gigartina spp. for carrageenin, Iridophycus spp. for iridophycin. As a food for human consumption, Porphyra spp. are well known to the 'phycophages' of the orient.\n\nRed algae are treated either as a division Rhodophyta or as a class Rhodophyceae according to the particular scheme.\n\nGreen algae: algae with chloroplasts grass-green from a predominance of chlorophylls a and b largely are of fresh or brackish water or moist soil, but quite a few are marine either as pelagic plankton or attached in the littoral zone. A cell wall of cellulose or pectin is usual, while starch is the principal reserve food. When unicellular, the structure may be simple and microscopic (e.g. Chlorella) or elaborately developed as in the marine Caulerpa where a creeping rhizome-like surculus of indefinite growth develops along its length geotropic rhizoids or holdfasts and assimilatory green fronds of diverse form. Again, the single cell (or coenocyte) may be bladder-like as in some Codium.  When multicellular, single rows of cells may remain simple (as in Spirogyra) or branch as filaments (e.g. Chaetophora), or the filaments may unite laterally to form a single or double-layered membrane (as in the Sea Lettuce Ulva) or a tube simple (Chaetomorpha) or branched (Cladophora). Life cycles throughout show an alternation of generations which may be cytological, only the sporophyte conspicuous (e.g. Codium) and more a feature of those marine or of fresh water periodically exposed to the atmosphere. Often flagellate stages are present. When a morphological difference, the sporophyte and gametophyte may be similar (mainly marine, e.g. Enteromorpha) or the gametophyte dominant, the sporophyte represented by the zygote (fresh water, e.g. Spirogyra, Oedogonium).\n\nGreen algae have received particular attention from the aspect of their highly efficient synthesis of organic compounds, coupled with an adaptability of unicells (e.g. Chlorella) to large-scale culture. Such features have applications to the world food problem in addition to control of carbon dioxide and oxygen exchange e.g. in spacecraft and atomic submarines. Some of the major problems of physiological processes (e.g. photosynthesis) have been elucidated through studies of their group.\n\nModern treatments place the 'greens' as a class, Chlorophyceae, under a division Chlorophyta. The calcium carbonate extracting stoneworts Chara and Nitella of brackish or fresh water have strong links with, or have been derived from, the green algae and have been treated as a second class (Charophyceae) of the Chlorophyte. The stonewort thallus is multicellular and an elaboration of an erect stem-like structure (up to 1 metre long) from which arise verticels of branches; the plant is attached to the soil by rhizoids. Remains of Chara accumulated over a large number of years have led to the formation of limestones.\n\nEuglenoids: some of the most primitive green algae are unicells motile by two flagella (e.g. Chlamydomonas). Also possessing green chloroplasts and a flagellum are the euglenoids, considered as a direct derivation from the flagellate green algae. Euglenoids are asexual unicells lacking a rigid wall and on the threshold of the plant-animal divergence. The reserve food is a starch-like paramylum. A distinctive feature is the invagination (a narrow canal or gullet) of the periplast (the elastic pellicle or outer surface), leading from which is a single (rarely 2) flagellum and at its base a red pigment spot (stigma). Orientation to light is possible through the shading effect of the stigma to a light-sensitive swelling (photoreceptor) at the base of the flagellum. The major genus Euglena has members found in ponds rich in organic matter, others epiphytic on plankton, or endobiotic to plants or animals.\n\nThe status of the euglenoids has been considered divisional (as Euglenophyta).\n\nYellow-green algae and allies: algae with a carotenoid pigment masking the chlorophyll generally are either motile unicells, some with a tendency to form filaments, or non-motile multicells, filamentous and with a tendency to elaborate structure. The first group is of universal distribution, with many members on the threshold of the plant-animal divergence, nutritionally holozoic. The carotenoid pigments, or xanthophylls, differ among the various families but the predominant colours are brown, yellow, or yellow-green. The food reserve is either a starch (or starch-like compound or a polysaccharide, leucosin, in addition to fatty oils. The storage of starch usually is associated with a deposition of cellulose within the cell wall (when present) but there is no tendency to the use of silica, although a sculptured envelope is common. This association is found in the dinoflagellates (the much larger group, the members especially of plankton) and the cryptomonads, both mostly marine.\n\nWith storage of leucosin there is a greater tendency for the cells to form colonies or filaments, or be coenocytic, and when a cell wall is present, silica is the main building substance. The pigment fucoxanthin may be present to give a golden-brown colour, the cell then either flagellate and without a wall (the chrysomonads), or without flagella and with a wall highly silicified and composed of two closely overlapping parts, valves, usually of intricate design (the diatoms, whose fossils have contributed to the formation of petroleum in addition to forming the diatomaceous earths providing the diatomite or kieselguhr of commerce used in filtration, face and polishing powder manufacture, and as an absorbent of nitroglycerine in the manufacture of dynamite). When fucoxanthin is absent, the chromatophores mostly are yellow-green, the plants either unicellular flagellates without cell walls (the chloromonads) or unicellular non-flagellates with cell walls (the yellow-green algae).\n\nOf these diverse groups, present treatment affords divisional status collectively to the dinoflagellates and cryptomonads (Pyrophyta), and to the chrysomonads, diatoms, chloromonads, and yellow-greens (Chrysophyta).\n\nBrown algae: the more complex olive-brown (fucoxanthin) pigmented (additional to chlorophylls a and c) algae possess cell walls of cellulose, commonly store the polysaccharide laminarin and the alcohol mannitol as the food reserves. They form from simple or branched filaments or membranes to multi-layered systems of cells differentiated to internal conducting and storage tissues and external absorbing and assimilating tissues. Life-cycles in the main follow the lines of the green algae, the male gametes being flagellate. Very few of the brown algae are of fresh water; as marine plants mainly of temperate and polar waters, they commonly form marked littoral zones. Many (e.g. Ecklonia, Sargassum, Macrocystis) develop a basal hold-fast, a stem-like stipe bearing leaf-like segments, and a petiole-like inflated vescicle or pneumatocyst which displays the lamina above in vertical position.\n\nProminent among the brown algae are the kelps, a group of the order Laminariales which reach gigantic size (e.g. Macrocystis pyrifera recorded in Australian waters up to 30 metres long) and make up submarine 'forests'. While only Ecklonia and Macrocystis are of general occurrence around the Australian (southern) coast, the kelps overseas have provided sources for iodine, potash, acetone, but present attention is given to the extraction and utilisation of the phycocolloid sodium alginate or align in such diverse fields as foods, drugs, cosmetics, paints, textiles. Although containing more than 95 percent water, the use of kelps as fertilisers is long established. See also coenobium, lichen, photosynthesis."

Thus A. Cunn. ex Benth. indicates that Bentham validly published a name originally proposed by Cunningham but not published by him. When a name has a horticultural origin, Hort. (from hortulanarium) is used before the 'ex'. When a species or lower rank is transferred to another taxon, with or without change of status, its name is retained (unless such name is in use, preoccupied, within the new taxon) and is followed by the author's name in parenthesis, followed by the name of the effecting author. e.g. Grevillea buxifolia (Sm.) R.Br. indicates that for the plant now known by the combination given by Robert Brown, James Smith had published earlier with his diagnosis the name Embothrium buxifolium. When a name with a description, or reference to a description, supplied by one author is published in the work of another author, the word 'in' is used to connect the two. e.g. Eucalyptus alpina Lindl. in Mitch.\n\nWhen desirable to abbreviate the citation, the name of the author supplying the description or effecting a transfer should be retained. e.g. Eucalyptus alpina Lindl., Phyllota phylicoides Benth. (from P. phylicoides (Sieb. ex D.C.) Benth.)."

        "id": 3820,
        "term": "Bacterium",
        "meaning": "(plural bacteria) a micro-organism which, although of definite cellular organisation, has the essential parts of its protoplast undifferentiated (diffuse), not (as in plants of higher levels) limited by complex membranes to organelles. While usually heterotrophic (hence parasitic or saprophytic) from an absence of chlorophyll or other light-fixing pigment, may also be chemoautotrophic by the ability to extract carbon from carbon dioxide through energy derived by the oxidation of inorganic compounds (e.g. of nitrogen, sulphur, iron), or photosynthetic by possession of a type of chlorophyll or other pigment but then strictly anaerobic. Possesses the nucleic acid DNA concentrated in in a more or less definite nucleus (or nuclear apparatus) and, although asexually reproducing, transference of genetic material (simple chromosomes capable of mutating) is possible through a type of conjugation, usually only part of the DNA being transferred on a donor-recipient basis.\n\nThe habitat of the bacterium may be soil, water, air, or host. It may be thermophilic and tolerate (or require) temperatures up to 50°C or more (e.g. Thermomonospora, Thermoactinomyces) or barophilic and withstand pressures up to 600 atmospheres. It may be bioluminescent or diffuse to its medium fluorescent pigments. In some cases, e.g. Clostridium a survival feature is the intracellular development of highly resistant resting-bodies (endospores) which are released on dissolution of the parent cell and may remain viable for many years.\n\nThe organism may remain unicellular or be divided by septa to become multi-cellular and form a trichome. It may be motile by a flagellum or flagella (of a single fibril), by a gliding movement on a solid surface or by a spiralling movement. When unicellular, is typically of the spherical (coccoid), rod-shaped (bacillar), helical or spiral (spirillum) or filamentous form, and may unite with others to form a chain, e.g. Streptococcus with some species forming chains up to 150 microns long, or form clusters, or in a few, a firm-textured gelatinous matrix (zoogloea). The protoplast is limited by a membrane probably of lipoprotein nature, externally lined by a thin, usually rigid, cell-wall probably of cellulose or hemicellulose and possibly with chitin. The cell-wall is enclosed by a slime-layer of a polysaccharide (e.g. galactan) which, when conspicuously developed and in close contact with the cell, forms a capsule. In trichomes, the capsule is replaced by a sheath from which a stalk-like attachment (holdfast) to the surface frequently is developed.\n\nThe nature of the cell-wall provides the basis for the well known but little understood Gram-reaction (first developed by the Danish physician Christian Gram in 1884), the differential staining of the cell by crystal violet (or methyl violet) for a definite period followed by an iodine solution, a decolourising by alcohol and counter-staining by safranin when a resultant blue stain indicates a positive (gram-positive) reaction, and red a gram-negative reaction. The decolourising agent appears prevented entry by a barrier of high lipid content of the Gram-positive wall.\n\nA member of the most primitive group of organisms with an unknown, doubtfully monophyletic origin. Certain bacteria show afinity with the blue green algae (Cyanophyceae or Schizophyceae) and cyrrent classifications place the bacteria as class Schizomycetes with the class Schizophyceae under a common division Schizophyta or Protophyta, the latter division adding the viruses as class Microtatobiotes.  In consideration of the vast field of bacteriology, the following superficial sketch is given to illustrate the diverse nature of this ubiquitous group of organisms.\n\nA.\n\nunicellular, rigid-walled, coccoid, bacillar, or spiral, usually less than 2 microns wide, sometimes in chains, clusters or in zoogloeal masses, usually motile by terminal (polar) flagella, gram-negative. Reproduction by simple transverse fission. -order Pseudomonadales.\n\nIncluded is a sub-order (Rhodobacteriinae) of photo-synthetic anaerobes which oxidise compounds either of sulphur or carbon. When sulphur, carotenoids may mask a chlorophyll to give red and purple colours. The chlorophyll, bacterio-chlorophyll, absorbs from the visible and infra-red spectrum of light. Red and purple sulphur bacteria are strictly anaerobic at least when exposed to light and usually are associated with hydrogen sulphide-containing waters, the sulphide being oxidised to sulphur which is stored within the cell. Forms include the unicellular, motile, encapsuled type (e.g. Chromatium), sometimes colonial, usually about or less than 2 microns wide although the spirally twisted Thiospirillum may be up to 4 microns or more wide and over 40 microns in length.\n\nWhen carotenoids are not prominent, a type of chlorophyll absorbing from the infra-red region gives a green colour, or an unidentified photosynthetic pigment may give a yellowish-green colour. The green sulphur bacteria (e.g. Chlorobium) are unicellular non-motile organisms of marine and fresh water muds, Chlorobium (less than 2 microns wide) oxidising hydrogen sulphide to sulphur which, deposited outside the cell, may be further oxidised to a sulphate by an external outflow of enzymes.\n\nWhen carbon compounds (e.g. alcohols, acetates, lactates) are the hydrogen donors (hydrogen sulphide not being oxidised), colours may be red, purple, or brown, both bacteriochlorophyll and carotenoids being present. Because of a need for organic sources, such coloured bacteria are not strictly autotrophic. The red and purple non-sulphur bacteria (e.g. Rhodopseudomonas) typically are unicellular, less than 2 microns wide, motile and colonial.\n\nWithin the second sub-order (Pseudomonadineae) are the chemoautotrophic bacteria which are colourless, mostly aerobic and using carbon dioxide as the sole source of carbon, usually of soil or water, e.g. the nitrifying bacteria Nitrosomonas and Nitrococcus which oxidise ammonia to nitrate, and Nitrobacter and Nitrocystis which oxidise nitrite to nitrate. In addition, other inorganic compounds are oxidised, e.g. hydrogen to water by Hydrogenomonas, methane by Methanamonas, hydrogen sulphide or a thiosulphate by Thiobacillus (sulphur usually deposited within the cell, ammonia often being used, T. denitrificans in the process reducing nitrate to nitrite), carbon monoxide etc.\n\nThe remainder of the sub-order are heterotrophic and mostly aerobic.  Representative are:-\n\nthe pathogens of plants Pseudomonas (e.g. wilt of potatoes, gummosis of cherry) and Xanthomonas (e.g. leaf scald of sugar cane, leaf spot of cotton), a species of Pseudomonas diffusing a flourescent pigment used as an indicator dye pyocyanin.\n\nacetic acid bacilli (e.g. the aerobic Acetobacter and Acetomonas) which oxidise various organic compounds to organic acids, alcohol to acetic acid, glucose to gluconic or keto-glutonic acid - these are agents of industrial fermentation.\n\nthe marine or fresh-water bioluminescent Photobacterium, sometimes fluorescent Alginomonas, curved bacilli of Gallionella which are attached to a surface by a ribbon-like stalk composed of, or with deposits of iron oxide, Spirillum of stagnant or organically-rich water, with a spiral axis.\n\nsewage purifying bacilli, primary colonisers of the percolating filter (bacterial bed) of sewage disposal as the first stage of its purification, and the alternative system of activated sludge. Zoogloea which gives the name to the colonial form of certain other bacteria.\n\nthe pathogenic members of Vibrio, curved bacilli, e.g. the agent of Asiatic cholera V. comma.\n\nB.\n\n﻿﻿unicellular or multicellular bacilli, heterotrophic, 2 microns or less wide occurring in chains (trichomes) often ensheathed, the sheath usually impregnated with iron or manganese oxides, freeing cells which are either motile or non-motile, gram negative, of fresh water or marine. Chlamydobacteriales. (e.g. Sphaerotilus, Leptothrix).\n\nC.\n\n﻿﻿Cells in dense groups with radiating filaments from the end of which may be formed (budded) a daughter cell (Hyphomicrobium, Rhodomicrobium) or unicellular, ovoid, spherical or pyriform attached at the end of a stalk from a holdfast, budding occurring at the free end of the cell (e.g. Pasteuria), of soil or mud of fresh water. Rhodomicrobium is photosynthetic. Hyphomicrobiales.\n\nD.\n\nunicellular, rigid-walled, coccoid or bacillar, sometimes pleiomorphic, heterotrophic, usually less than 2 microns wide, motile or non-motile, the flagella when present not polar (i.e. are normally peritrichous). Reproduction by transverse fission. Saprophytic, parasitic, often pathogenic, of fresh and salt water, air, soil, animal and plant hosts. Sometimes occurring in chains but not as trichomes. Eubacteriales.\n\nIn this, the major group of bacteria, the following are illustrative.\n\n(i) gram-negative, motile, aerobic bacilli or cocci, free-living in soil, fixing atmospheric nitrogen - Azotobacter (e.g. A. chroococcum).\n\n(ii)gram-negative, motile or non-motile, aerobic bacilli associated with the roots of plants either as symbionts (Rhizobium spp. in the nodules of leguminous plants where nitrogen-fixing) or as pathogens causing malformations (e.g. Agrobacterium tumefaciens causing crown-gall).\n\n(iii)gram-negative bacilli, carbohydrate-fermenting, occurring in alimentary canals either normally commensal (e.g. Escherichia coli, Proteus vulgaris) or pathogenic (causing, e.g. gastroenteritis by species of Salmonella, typhoid fever by S. typhi, dysentery by Shigella spp.), or parasitic on plants causing soft rots (e.g. several species of Erwinia). The entero-bacteria.\n\n(iv)gram-negative aerobic bacilli pathogenic on mammals, e.g. Brucella (brucellosis, undulant fever in man, contagious abortion oi cattle), Haemophilus (e.g. purulent meningitis, infections of the respiratory tract, conjunctivitis), Pasteurella (various septicemias, bubonic and pneumonic plagues by P. pestis).\n\n(v) gram-positive, aerobic cocci.\n\n(a)the lactic acid cocci, homofermenters of carbohydrates to lactic acid, e.g. the chain-forming Streptococcus, some species commonly found in dairy products, sometimes causing the souring of milk, one S. cremoris used in butter and cheese making, others common commensals of the respiratory tract and alimentary canal (a few anaerobic) or pathogenic S. pyogenes producing the toxins associated with scarlet fever and various septicemias.\n\n(b)the cluster-forming micrococci common on, or in, skin and mucous membranes, e.g. Staphylococcus aureus ('golden staph' highly resistant to the normal antibiotics, causative of some bronchopneumonias, food-poisoning (gastro-enteritis), various skin infections.\n\n(vi)gram-negative cocci, kidney-shaped or hemispherical occurring in pairs, non-motile, aerobic, pathogens, e.g. Neisseria gonorrhoeae (gonococcus, causative of gonorrhoea and other venereal diseases). N. meningitidis (meningococcus, an invader of the nasopharynx spreading to the central nervous system to cause a meningitis).\n\n(vii) gram-positive, aerobic, non-sporing bacilli.\n\n(a) ﻿﻿﻿﻿lactic acid bacilli. Fermenters of carbohydrates to lactic acid either almost completely (homofermentative) or with the production of additional compounds as carbon dioxide, ethanol, acetic acid (heterofermentative) Lactobacillus delbrueckii of industrial fermentation, a homofermentative agent converting maltose and dextrose to lactic acid. Commonly occur in fermenting plant (e.g. vegetable and grain mashes, fruit juices) and animal products (e.g. cheese, milk) in association with the yeasts.\n\n(b)the several members of Corynebacterium pathogenic on plants and animals, e.g. C. diphtheriae of diphtheria.\n\n(viii) gram-positive, non-motile, non-sporing anaerobic bacilli normally found in alimentary canals fermenting carbohydrates with the production of carbon dioxide and acetic acid, additionally propionic acid (Propionibacterium) or butyric acid (Butyribacterium).\n\n(ix) endospore-producing bacilli, the endospore often wider than the producing cell which is swollen as a result. Mostly saprophytes of soil, e.g. the aerobic Bacillus (B. subtilis of industrial fermentation producing glycerol, ethanol, lactic acid, and amylolytic, pectolytic and proteolytic enzymes. B. anthracis causative of anthrax, a disease leading to haemorrhagic septicemia), the anaerobic Clostridium, several (e.g. C. butyricum) nitrogen-fixing but many pathogenic. C. tetani and C. botulinum produce a toxin (exotoxin) causing diseases of the nervous system when diffused into the animal body. Unlike C. tetani (tetanus), C. botulinum (botulism) need have no direct contact with the host of its toxin. Butanol, ethanol, acetone and ribofiavin are derivatives from C. acetobutylicum of industrial fermentation.\n\nE.\n\na definite mycelium developed in young stages (the hyphae more or less a micron diameter) which may break up into segments, sometimes branched (Nocardia, Actinomyces), or remain intact and (e.g. Streptomyces) produce spores (conidia) at the ends of aerial hyphae (conidiophores) or other spores (sporangiospores) formed by fragmentation or segmentation of hyphae (sporangia). In Mycobacterium, a mycelium is either poorly or not developed, no spores are formed but a multicellular nature is suspected. Gram-positive, mostly of soil, heterotrophic. Actinomycetales.\n\nSome pathogens of animals and plants (e.g. the aerobes of Nocardia and anaerobes of Streptomyces), several streptomyces sources of antibiotics, e.g. streptomycin used in treatment of tuberculosis from S. griseus, aureomycin from S. aureofaciens, chloramphenicol from S. venezuela, etc. S. scabies causative of Common Scab of potatoes.\n\nThe gram-stain resistant tubercle bacilli of Mycobacterium include M. tuberculosis, and the agent of leprosy M. leprae.\n\nThermoactinomyces includes thermophilic (e.g. an optimum 60°C) agents of humus-formation.\n\nF.\n\nmulticellular filaments (trichomes) sometimes up to 2,000 microns, not enclosed in a sheath, frequently motile, often forming endospores, with a Feulgen reactive (i.e. DNA positive) disc-shaped central nuclear apparatus, heterotrophic, of decomposing organic matter, water, intestines. Caryophanales (Caryophanon, Simonsiella etc.).\n\nG.\n\noccurring in trichomes, sometimes unicellular, motile not by flagella but by a gliding or rolling motion when in contact with a solid substrate hence with a fexible wall, cell width up to 70 microns. Marine, fresh water, soil, or decomposing organic matter, heterotrophic. Beggiatoales (e.g. Beggiatoa, Thiothrix).\n\nH.\n\nvegetative cells bacillar or fusiform, gram-negative, flexible, not flagellate but motile by a slow gliding movement. Colonial in a thin flat plasmodium from the margins of which single cells or groups of cells migrate, usually leaving a trail of slime. Resting cells (sometimes absent) formed singly from a cell which, together with others, are localised in a usually brightly-coloured fruiting-body. Occur in rotting vegetable matter or decaying wood, soil, water both fresh and salt. When marine chitin and agar may be digested; when terrestrial cellulose may be broken down. Slime bacteria (e.g. Cytophaga, Myxococcus, Chondrococcus etc.). Myxobacterales.\n\nI.\n\nflexible, spirally-wound, actively motile but not flagellate, up to 30 microns or more in length, some (e.g. Spirochaetes) with a group of fibrils wound round the main axis and appearing as a single axial filament. Occur as free-living saprophytes of stagnant fresh or salt water, some pathogenic, e.g. the strictly parasitic Treponema pallidum causing syphilis, T. pertenue the tropical disease yaws; Leptospira species causing a jaundice and meningitis bovine leptospirosis affecting cattle and man, Borrelia species relapsing fever. Spirochaetes. Spirochaetales.\n\nJ.\n\n﻿﻿cocci extremely small (up to 300 millimicrons) producing branching filaments up to 50 microns long which later become chains of spherical bodies released by fragmentation, as highly resistant cocci, non-motile, gram-negative. Saprophytic, parasitic or pathogenic. A single genus Mycoplasma causing pleuropneumonias, e.g. M. mycoides contagious pleuropneumonia in cattle. Mycoplasmatales.\n\nK.\n\n﻿﻿Cocci or bacilli (but often pleiomorphic), gram-negative, intermediate in size to the bacteria and the filterable viruses, obligate parasites occurring usually within the cells of vertebrate host or an invertebrate host (e.g. louse, tick) which may be a vector. Classified as an order in association with the Virales (viruses) forming a class Microtatobiotes, the two groups having in common an incapacity for reproduction outside a living cell, but the viruses are far less susceptible to the normal antibiotics. Rickettsiales. e.g. Rickettsia, R. prowazeki the louse-borne agent of scrub typhus. Others, e.g. Anaplasma, are parasites of red blood cells. Miyagawanella spp. certain types of viral pneumonia and the diseases transmissible from birds to man, psittacosis from M. psittaci with hosts psittacine birds, e.g. parrots, and ornithosis from M. ornithosis with hosts usually other than psittacine types but causative of similar disease."

        "meaning": "(phage) a virus dependent on a bacterium for its reproduction. A DNA-containing, protein-coated form spherical in shape when simple but when complex tadpole-like with definite head and tail and up to 200 millimicrons long. While the protein coat is retained on the surface of the bacterial host, the DNA is injected within to take over direction of metabolic processes. This direction may lead to the formation of a number of new phages which are released for infection of other bacterial cells when rupturing (lysis) of the host cell occurs. In other cases, a form of commensalism is known to occur when the phage remains (as a prophage) to cause certain metabolic changes which may lead to an increased degree of resistance or toxicity of the bacterial host."

        "id": 4630,
        "term": "Bryophyte",
        "meaning": "a multicellular, photosynthetic, non-vascular or partially vascular plant, mostly terrestrial, with habit prostrate and thalloid or erect and composed of stem and leaves, attached to a substratum by absorptive capillary-like rhizoids, usually inconspicuous except when in mass. An embryophyte with regular heteromorphic alternation of generations, the diploid (sporophytic) generation never completely independent from the haploid (gametophytic) generation, the sex organs multicellular with the reproductive cells ensheathed by a wall of sterile cells, the female reproductive cell solitary in its archegonium.\n\nA plant generally believed to represent a terrestrial line to dominance of the gametophyte from an ancestor derived from the green algae, the other line represented by the vascular plant with the sporophyte the dominant phase. Its classification embraces three classes, hornworts (Anthocerotae), liverworts (Hepaticae) and mosses (Musci).\n\nThe macroscopic plant, the gametophyte, normally developed from a spore, bears multicellular antheridia (producing flagellate male gametes) and archegonia (producing within each an egg cell). Fertilisation requires moist conditions, the fusion of the motile gamete with the egg-cell leads to the development of an embryo from which arises the sporophyte (a sporogonium) usually enveloped by a sheath or calyptra formed by enlargement of the venter of the archegonium. The mature sporogonium is composed of a spore-bearing structure (capsule) and a basal absorbing part, a foot. Meiotic division of spore mother-cells forms the tetrads of spores which are released on rupture of the capsule, dispersed by wind or water, and develop under moist conditions to new gametophytes. In many liverworts and hornworts, elongated sterile cells, elaters, formed within the capsule concurrently with spores, aid in dispersal through a hygroscopic sensitivity. Gametophytes may be developed also from separated parts or from bud-like gemmae.\n\n\nHornworts\n\nIn this group, a simple thallus develops dorsiventrally and has within each cell a large chloroplast, part of which is a region of protein (a pyrenoid) asociated with the formation of starch. Rhizoidsare unicellular. The origin of sex organs is from internal cells of the dorsal surface of the thallus, the archegonia almost completely embedded. Growth from the archegonial region forms a sheath through which pushes the apex of the capsule. The sporogonium is complex and elongates to an indefinite length from active division of a meristematic region between foot and capsule. It has a central axis (columella) of sterile cells encircled by the spore-bearing tissue, chloroplasts and often stomata. Two genera of note are the widespread Anthoceros with thallus lobed or crisped on the margin bearing on its ventral surface mucilage cavities containing colonies of the blue-green alga Nostoc, and the tropical epiphytic Dendroceros with thallus a single cell in thickness but with a large thick mid-rib projecting below.\n\nThe much larger groups of liverworts and mosses differ from the hornworts by the greater number of chloroplasts (without pyrenoids) within each cell, the origin of the sex organs from superficial cells, and the absence of a meristematic region at the foot of the capsule. Rhizoids of liverworts are unicellular (hence comparable to root-hairs of vascular plants) but in mosses are chains of single cells. Archegonia of mosses and some leafy liverworts are formed at the tip of the stem or its branches, thus arresting further growth from these points (the acrogynous condition), or in other leafy liverworts (of the anacrogynous condition) from other than an apical cell and without arrest of growth. Both archegonia and antheridia may occur on the same plant (the plant then homothallic) or on different plants (then heterothallic or dioecious). When homothallic, the plant is paroecious when both organs occur on the same branch but are segregated, autoecious when occurring on different branches, and synoecious when intermixed on the same branch. Leaves (when present) subtending these organs often are different in shape and size from other leaves and are referred to as perichaetal when distinguishing them from foliage leaves. Of the sporogonium, a connective seta of capsule and foot is usual which, by elongation, pushes the capsule through the calyptra on maturation of the spores (liverworts) or at an early stage in the development of the embryo (mosses).\n\n\nLiverworts\n\nDevelopment of the liverwort from a spore is dorsiventral, leading to a usually dichotomously branched thallus or (a majority) a branched foliose stem. Sex organs develop from single initial cells on the dorsal or anterior surface. The capsule is without a columella but usually develops elaters. While a few liverworts are aquatic (e.g. Riccia fluitans) and a few others can withstand periodic desiccation, the common habitat is a shaded moist site. Some are epiphytes, others epiphylls. Greatest representation of the several orders is from the tropical northern hemisphere but the orders Marchantiales (e.g. Marchantia, Riccia) and Jungermanniales are well represented in Australia. Sex organs of Marchantia are borne on stalked, 'umbrella-like' branches archegoniophores and antheridiophores) but in Riccia these organs occur directly on the dorsal surface of the thallus. For the Jungermanniales, the origin of archegonia may be either anacrogynous (e.g. Ricardia, Pallavicinia) or acrogynous (e.g. Porella, Plagiochila). Growth from the gametophytic tissue close to the archegonium produces a tissue, an involucre, which ensheaths the calyptra of the young sporophyte. When anacrogynous, the plant usually is undifferentiated to stem and leaves, the sexual organs borne laterally and on the dorsal surface of short lateral branches of the thallus. When acrogynous, the plant is foliose, usually with three rows of leaves along a stem, the antheridia globular, borne on long stalks and axillary to the leaves. Leaves subtending sex organs are termed bracts, those below archegonia perichaetal bracts and those below antheridia perigonial bracts. A few of the uppermost perichaetal bracts are fused to form a perianth which encloses the capsule.\n\n\nThe Mosses\n\nGreatest specialisation and diversity are shown by this major group. Distribution is wide with some favour for the colder regions of the world. Germination of a spore leads to a filamentous or thalloid (Sphagnum) protonema which usually dies after formation of an erect branch, a gametophore, bearing the sex organs. The gametophore arises from the protonema as a lateral bud which develops a pyramidal apical cell, division at each face of the cell (cutting face) forming a leaf so that, in most, a branch with three vertical rows of leaves is built. On these leafy branches are borne the sex organs. Rhizoids of both protonema and gametophore are multicellular. The leaves are spirally and symmetrically arranged on a stem composed of a central cylinder, cortex, and epidermis. Development of archegonia is acrogynous. The capsule is without elaters but usually with a columnella, and (except in Andraea) an apical cap, an operculum.\n\nThree groups make up the mosses - bog (or peat) mosses (sub-class Sphagnobrya), granite mosses (sub-class Andreaobrya) and true mosses (sub-class Eubrya).\n\nThe bog mosses (Sphagnum) frequently cover large tracts of swampy lands. There is an abundance of water-absorbing large hyaline cells in contrast with relatively few chlorophyll-bearing cells. A single gametophore is produced from the thallus, archegonia in a terminal cluster, the antheridia axillary to the leaves. The sporogonium is composed of a large globular capsule with a neck-like connective at its base representing a seta, and a bulbous foot. The function of the seta is taken over by an elongation (a pseudopodium) formed from the axis of the branch.\n\nGranite mosses (Andraea, Neuroloma) usually occur on siliceous rocks of arctic or alpine regions. The gametophores usually bear the sex organs in terminal groups on separate branches. The sporogonium is similar to that of Sphagnum except that the capsule is enclosed by a calyptra and dehisces through four valves.\n\nTrue mosses (e.g. Dawsonia, Funaria, Polytrichum) represent the peak of the bryophyte's evolutionary development. They have universal occurrence in habitats ranging from rock faces to ponds to tree trunks. In addition to the filamentous protonema, constant features include a sporogonium with an elongated seta, a capsule photosynthetic and often with stomates internally differentiated to several tissues and opening by an operculum which overlies a hygroscopically sensitive tissue, a peristome, of aid in the control of spore-dispersal.\n\nThe role of the moss and other bryophytes as early colonisers of barren sites and the power to bind soil against erosion are of recognised economic importance. Sphagnum among other mosses contributes to formation of peat, this compressed and carbonised residue has yielded materials and products ranging over fuel, ethyl alcohol, nitrogen source, paper and insulating material, a moisture-retentive medium for plant propagation (additional to Sphagnum from an actively-growing source), and the root-penetrable seedling container commonly known as the 'jiffy-pot'."

    {
        "id": 6040,
        "term": "Cereal",
        "meaning": "a grass yielding grain of value as food for stock or man. Commonly cultivated and the chief parents of the domesticated strains are barley (Hordeum vulgare), maize (Zea mais), millet - white (Panicum miliaceum), Hungarian (Setaria italica), Japanese (Echinochloa frumentacea), oats (Avena byzantina, A. sativa), rice (Oryza sativa), rye (Secale cereale, sorghum (Sorghum spp), wheat (Triticum aestivum, T. durum).\n\nGrain refers to the fruit (a caryopsis) sometimes (barley, oats, rice) including the persistent 'hull' or 'husk' formed by the fused bracts (lemma and palea) of the floret. 'Kernel' also refers to the fruit (the 'groat' of oats) considered of two parts, bran (which includes the pericarp, testa and endosperm) and the germ (the embryo which generally forms a small basal swelling).\n\nWheat, barley and rice have been a staple source of food for a period predating history. At present, about two billion people are almost completely dependent on grain crops for subsistence, the food (while providing adequate calorific value) lacks certain amino acids (e.g. lysine) vital to an optimum diet for humans. Grain yields both carbohydrate and protein (rice, while yielding on a unit acreage basis the highest of cereals in calorific value, has the least protein), the carbohydrate making up about 80 percent of the grain has a particular concentration (chiefly as starch) in the endosperm, the protein is particularly abundant in the germ. Present also in the grain are fatty derivatives (e.g. phospholipids and fixed oils), vitamins of the B complex (e.g. thiamine, nicotinic acid, riboflavin), minerals (chiefy as phosphates and sulphates of potassium, magnesium and calcium).\n\nProcessing of the grain for consumption involves essentially the conversion of the starch to a digestible form as, e.g. the pre-cooked breakfast cereals and cereal stock feeds, porridge from oatmeal, boiled rice. Other processes may involve the removal of husk by abrasion and polishing, e.g. pearl barley, polished rice from 'paddy' or raw rice. The controlled, gradual grinding and sieving to a specified fineness of the separated endosperm (i.e. the milling of grain from wheat, rye, maize, barley) produces a white flour or meal. Certain flours and meals (viz. wheat and rye) possess two proteins, protamin and glutelin, which form with water a gluten with elastic and flow properties and an ability to ferment (activation by yeast) necessary for bread-making. By far wheat is the major source of grain for bread and other baked products, its selection of strain determined by its milling and baking qualities in addition to its response, as a crop, to local geographic conditions.\n\nStrains of wheat are termed 'hard' when their milled endosperm yields a coarse and gritty, free-flowing flour mostly of entire cells, soft when the milled product is very much finer with a tendency of the fragmented cells and free starch to combine. On the baking quality (or strength), a 'strong' wheat denotes a suitability for bread-making with a high protein content, 'weak' when more suitable for biscuit and cake making, or self-raising flour, when a coarse open crumb structure and relatively low protein content render it unsuitable for bread.  Coarse particles from the milling are used (as a semolina) in the processing of macaroni, sphagetti, and vermicilli.\n\nBarley grain provides a meal used as stock feed but is of particular importance in the fermentation and distilling industries - the production from the grain mash (which may include also grain of maize and rye except in beer and stout making) of alcohol through the processes of malting (involving germination of the grain to a malt for the activation by enzymes of starch) and brewing (the fermentation of the malt, or wort in beer-making by yeast through sugar to alcohol) and distillation of the fermented product to pure alcohol, or by various treatments (e.g. the addition of hops from Humulus lupulus to the mash in beer-making) to beer, stout, whiskey. Other products include furfural (used in various industrial processes, e.g. as a solvent), acetone, butanol, and riboflavin.\n\nThe cereal crop may be for grazing (rye, maize, sorghum, millet), for hay (oats, rye, maize, millet, sorghum) or silage. The millets provide grain as a human food in certain of the developing countries and birdseed to the muchbetter endowed; broom millet supplies the fibre for the well-known millet brooms."

Only (a) shows at photosynthesis the fluorescence normally involved in the process and indicating dissipated ('unused') energy, hence (a) is recognised as the sole carrier during photosynthetic reactions of energy absorbed by itself directly and from other photoactive pigments present.\n\nThe molecule of chlorophyll is composed of a complex cyclic structure (four pyrrole rings) within which is a single atom of magnesium, and a long straight chain (a terpenic alcohol, phytol). The phytol, and the magnesium atom (replaced in haem by iron), distinguish it from the colouring matter of vertebrate blood which forms, with the protein globin, haemoglobin. Both chlorophyll and haem are typed as metallic compounds of porphyrin groups. When extracted by a fat-solvent (e.g. alcohol), chlorophyll (a) appears blue-green in incident light with a red fluorescence, is optically active (laevorotatory) but loses much of its photochemical activity.

    },
    {
        "id": 7810,
        "term": "Conifer",
        "meaning": "a seed-bearing, usually monoecious, vascular plant, in habit a tree often tall, excurrent or fastigiate, or a shrub sometimes (e.g. Microcachrys) weakly-branched and straggling, with leaves evergreen, spirally-arranged, whorled or clustered, scale-like, needle-like, or narrow in form. Its male reproductive structure is cone-like, usually much smaller than the female, composed of an axis bearing spirally-arranged sporophylls, each sporophyll with two or more pollen-sacs (sporangia) within which is developed pollen-grain, usually the pollen produced in profusion and carried to the female by wind currents. The female or ovulate structure is composed essentially of a scale (ovuliferous scale) frequently occurring in a spirally-arranged or whorled series to form ultimately a woody cone. On the surface of the scale are borne one or more ovules, unenclosed except by a single integument.\n\nClassification: a member of the class Conopsida of some authors or class Coniferae of others, with orders Cordaitales, Ginkgoales, Taxales, and Coniferales.\n\nThe Cordaitales are known only from the fossil-record and conceivably are the ancestral line to conifers. Ginkgoales, based on the maidenhair tree Ginkgo biloba of China, possibly the oldest surviving seed-bearing plant, virtually extinct in the wild but frequently cultivated, have in common multi-veined broad and flat leaves and motile (male) gametes. These features are absent in the Taxales, an order unique in that no cone is evident either from fossil ancestors or present-day members (the taxads, including the yews of Taxus, and Torreya e.g. California nutmeg Torreya californica). The male structure is a whorled series of radially-symmetrical sporophylls (each with 4-6 pollen-sacs) and sterile scales, the female is solitary in the axils of foliage leaves or leaf-scales and composed of an axis from which arises a cup-like aril enclosing a single erect ovule. Not always is the female structure a cone in the major order, Coniferales, but here, from anatomic comparative studies of fossils and extant members, morphological reduction is implied.\n\nPodocarpaceae, Cephalotaxacae: of the two exceptional families of Coniferales, the ovule (and seed) either is subtended by a scale-like bract sometimes fleshy, or bears an aril often coloured and enclosing it, solitary in Podocarpaceae, paired in Cephalotaxacae (the plum-yews of eastern Asia). The Podocarpaceae have a particular distribution in the southern hemisphere and are represented in Australia by 7 of the 100 or so species of the monoecious Podocarpus mainly in rain forest e.g. Brown Plum P. elatus, Black Pine P. amarus, 1 of the 16 species of Dacrydium, the timber and essential oil yielding D. franklinii confined to Tasmania and now occurring in stands too inaccessible for present exploitation, two monotypic genera also confined to Tasmania, the shrubby Microcachrys tetragona and the timber tree Celery Top Pine Phyllocladus asplenifolius, finally two isolated species of Microstrobos, one (M. niphophilus) in Tasmania, one (M. fitzgeraldii) in New South Wales, both very local and at high altitudes. The New Zealand Dacrydium cupressinum provides the timber Rimu.\n\nCupressaceae: in other families of Coniferales there is rarer modification in the female cone. This is chiefly in the Cupressaceae where the fruit is fleshy and berry-like in the junipers, and small, rounded and with whorled scales in the cypresses (the fruit of both known sometimes as a galbulus). For this family both cone-scales and leaves are in whorls of two or more, the leaves frequently stem-appressed and scale-like. Callitris of 16 species has 14 endemic to Australia ranging from coast to inland, providing the cypress pine of the timber industry (viz. from C. hugelii) and the resin sandarac from the bark of C. verrucosa. Actinostrobos of two shrubby species is endemic to south-western Australia and the monotypic Diselma (D. archeri, a shrub) endemic to Tasmania. Widely cultivated throughout the continent and originating from the northern hemisphere are the cypresses (Cupressus), False Cypress (Chamaecyparis), thujas or Arbor Vitaes (Thuja) and the junipers. Juniperus communis of Europe provides fruit ('juniper berries') used, e.g., in gin-making and for extraction of an essential oil 'oil of juniper'. Tetraclinis articulata of north and north-west Africa, and Spain, yields the resin sandarac from its bark. Thuja plicata of North America provides the timber Western Red Cedar.\n\nAraucariaceae: the spiral arrangement of cone-scales and leaves is the rule in the remaining families of Coniferales. The seed may be solitary on the cone-scale and often embedded, the scale fused with the subtending bract, as in the Araucariaceae where the leaves predominantly are broad and flat (viz. Agathis) or awl-shaped and angled (some Araucaria). The Kauri Pines of Agathis are dispersed throughout the lands of the south Pacific, 3 of the 15 species being endemic to eastern Queensland. Araucaria of 10 species has 2 endemic to the tropical and sub-tropical eastern coast, Bunya Pine A. bidwillii and the more extensive Hoop Pine A. cunninghamii which reaches as far south as the Hastings River of New South Wales. Much cultivated along the eastern seaboard is Norfolk Island Pine A. excelsa. A. klinkii of New Guinea (Klinki Pine) and A. angustifolia of South America (Parana Pine) are sources of well-known timbers.\n\nPinaceae: the seed may be two per cone-scale (Pinaceae) or several (Taxodiaceae), the two families of the northern hemisphere with no natural representation in Australia. The value of the pines as timber trees has created their large-scale establishment in plantations (e.g. Pinus radiata, P. pinaster) to augment the depleted and naturally limited softwood timber sources. Overseas, several pines contribute the oleoresin turpentine from which colophony or rosin, oil of turpentine, and terebene are derived, and Stolkholm or Pine Tar. Typical of the pines are the dimorphic leaves and shoots. Normal long shoots bear achlorophyllous scale-leaves, supplementary short shoots axillary to the scale leaves bear 2, 3, or 5 green, needle-like leaves ensheathed at their base by scale-leaves, the short shoot deciduous as a unit and eventually replaced by male cones. In addition to the pines, the cedars (Cedrus), larches (Larix), spruces (Picea), tsugas (Tsuga), firs (Abies), have become parkland and hedgerow trees ubiquitous to the Australian landscape. Abies balsamea, the balsam fir of eastern Canada, yields the oleoresin Canada Balsam. Timbers familiar to Australian commerce include the North American Douglas Fir or Oregon (Pseudotsuga menziesii), Hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla) and the pines Monterey or Radiata (Pinus radiata), Loblolly (P. taeda), Ponderosa (P. ponderosa), Sugar (P. lambertiana), and the Sitka Spruce (Picea sitchensis), the European White Baltic Pine (Picea abies) and Red Baltic (Pinus sylvestris).\n\nTaxodiaceae: features here include the absence of distinct bracts to the cone-scales, the latter flat or shield-like and bearing 2 to 9 ovules, and the frequent dimorphic, narrow or scale-like leaves persistent on branches ultimately deciduous but not, as in Pinus, shed as a short shoot of a single leaf-cluster. World-famous are the Californian redwoods, e.g. Sequoia sempervirens and Sequoiadendron giganteum where heights up to 360 feet are recorded. In common with the famed Metasequoia glyptostroboides, the 'living-fossil' of China (and of the same family), and the bristlecone pines Pinus aristata of North America where stands believed 4,000 or more years old still exist, the redwoods are of great age and reflect their nature as relics from a greater, more extensive, distribution throughout the northern hemisphere during the early Tertiary of the Cainozoic era some 60 million years ago. The only Australian members of the Taxodiaceae are the three species of Athrotaxis endemic to Tasmania, two King Billy Pine A. selaginoides and Pencil Pine A. cupressoides are valuable though depleted timber trees. Well-known from their frequent cultivation are the cryptomerias (Cryptomeria) and taxodiums (Taxodium)."

        "id": 9050,

        "meaning": "a dioecious cone-bearing seed plant which, from its erect usually unbranched trunk (from subterranean to several feet high), often armoured by the persistent bases of petioles, bearing a dense crown of frond-like, pinnately compound leaves, has an appearance intermediate to that of a fern and a palm. In some, the appearance is closer to the ancient seed-ferns (pteridosperms) with which evidence suggests a far greater affinity than with the conifers formerly believed the closest relatives.\n\n The cycad trunk shows little or no secondary growth. The reproductive structure is a cone (not homologous with that of the conifer) either male or female, often very large ('pineapple-like') made up of a number of spirally. arranged cone-scales (sporophylls) except the females in families not Australian. The male cone-scale bears numerous pollen-sacs, the female bears a single marginal pair of ovules when spirally-arranged in a cone (or, when not forming a cone, the ovules marginal and several). The spores are dimorphic, the male (pollen-grain) dispersed by wind but prior to fertilisation develop to multi-flagellate sperm of macroscopic size, the largest spermatozoids of the plant kingdom. The macrospores develop to multi-cellular gametophytes within which, after pollination, ovules (or very much reduced archegonia) are formed, each ovule producing an egg-cell. Ultimate fertilisation leads to the formation of a seed of large size, with endosperm, a three-layered coat, and an embryo with two hypogeal cotyledons.\n\nClassification of the cycad is unsettled. Some authors treat it at divisional level (as Cycadophyta), others as a class (Cycadopsida or Cycadae) with a single order Cycadales. Two monogeneric families Cycadaceae (Cycas) and Stangeriaceae (Stangeria) and a family Zamiaceae of several genera are established. The Australian representation is from 3 of the 8 genera of Zamiaceae, i.e. Lepidozamia, Macrozamia (including the well-known burrawang M. communis), and Bowenia (of tropical Queensland).\n\nStems and seed of cycads provide sources for starch, the sago of commerce while largely from the sago palms of Metroxylon is also derived from certain cycads, both palms and cycads chiefly of Indonesia and the Philippines. Seed of Macrozamia stores a toxin, macrozamin, which may be rendered innocuous by roasting and soaking treatments, a procedure adopted by the aborigines in their preparation of the seed as food. Extraction of starch ana a jelly-like gum from Macrozamia was a small industry in pre-war New South Wales."

        "meaning": "a cymose inflorescence including the monochasium and dichasium and their derivatives, and the pleiochasium when there are more than two lateral branches.\n\nThe monochasium, with a single lateral branch, occurs usually when the leaf arrangement of the stem is alternate. Its derivatives are the helicoid cyme (or bostryx) when the unilateral branch order is repeated from the single lateral branch, and scorpioid cyme (or cincinnus) when branching from the lateral branch is in an alternating series. Modifications based on the occurrence of flowers in a single plane are the rhipidium of the bostryx as shown by members of Iridaceae, and the drepanium of the cincinnus as shown by members of Juncaceae. Derivatives of the monochasium tend to resemble the monopodium of racemose inflorescences (q.v.) but here branches are always axillary to the leaf (or bract) of the main axis, the pseudo-branches of the cyme being opposite to the leaf or bract when present.\n\nWhen both axillary shoots below the terminal flower of the cyme develop, the inflorescence is a dichasium which, by further branching from the lateral branches, becomes a compound dichasium. Various modifications occur, e.g. a false dichotomous cyme may arise by suppression or loss of the terminal flower, a helicoid or scorpioid cyme may arise by suppression or loss of buds on one side. When internodes of a helicoid cyme (both monochasial and dichasial) are so reduced that the flowers appear to arise from a common point, a monochasial or dichasial umbel may result, the latter being the case with a majority of eucalypts."

While none of these features applies to all dicots, there is also no clear separation from the monocotyledon which evidence favours as a derivation from an early dicot stock. Overall similarities and differences support their maintenance as separate classes.\n\nTreated by most authors as a class Dicotyledonae or other authors as sub-class Dicotyledonidae, the tendency has been to establish finer limits for orders and families as relationships become better known. Hutchinson, 1959 provides 80 orders linking about 340 families, some families with one or few members, others with thousands."

For sub-divisions, the suffixes recommendea are -phytina and (for fungi) -mycotina.\n\nIn earlier classifications divisional groups were thallophytes, bryophytes, gymnosperms, and angiosperms but these have lost some significance in the light of better-known relationships. Representative of current concepts is the classification of A. Cronquist (Bot. Rev. 26:4, 1960). Here, two sub-kingdoms proposed, Thallophyta and Embryophyta. Divisions of Thallophyta are Schizophyta (see bacterium), Rhodophyta, Chlorophyta, Euglenophyta, Pyrrophyta, Chrysophyta, Phaeophyta (see alga), and Fungi.  The common ancestor of the thallophytes is believed the bacterium. For the Embryophyta, divisions are Bryophyta (see bryophyte), Psilophyta (see psilopsid), Lepidophyta (see lycopsid), Calamophyta (see sphenopsid), Filicophyta (see fern), Coniferophyta (see gymnosperm), Cycadophyta (see cycad), Anthophyta (see angiosperm). This major group is believed ultimately derived from the thallophytes through the green algae. The psilophytes are considered ancestral or close to the ancestral line of vascular plants."

Its unit is the quantum, the most familiar being the photon of light energy, although some prominence now is given by the physicists to quanta of the atomic nucleus, lepton pairs and mesons. From Gk. energos, working.\n\nEnergy is conceived as the motivating force of all changes of physical and chemical states, all movement, all changes in equilibrium, and is transformable constant. Familiar examples of its forms are kinetic, potential, mechanical, electrical, electromagnetic, radioactive, atomic, thermal, radiant, chemical, etc. Within the atom or molecule, forms of energy are electronic (given by the orbital movement of the electron), vibrational, rotational, the transference of energy here believed to occur only in multiples of quanta. For any mass, energy is considered as of two components, one (free energy) available for conversion to some other form, and unavailable or bound energy measured as entropy. Heat as an accompaniment of all energy conversions represents a dissipation of free energy and an increase in entropy.\n\nThe capacity to conserve free energy from chemical reaction and to re-utilise it is a criterion of the living organism. In living proceses, the biosynthesis of organic compounds with high potential chemical energy from inorganic substances of low energy is fundamental to growth and development. The physical environment provides the raw materials, sunlight the energy source. Through photosynthesis, radiant energy is converted to chemical energy and through respiration this energy is released to be held and controlled by the organic phosphates. The flow of energy has a single pathway to virtually all forms of life."

The complete enzyme is the holo-enzyme when compound, the protein part is the apo-enzyme. Although of high molecular weight, the molecule of an enzyme is small enough to form in water a non-turbid electrolytic solution. As a rule, it has a specificity for a particular group of compounds or a single compound or its part, and can be denatured by heat, irradiation, ultra-violet light etc. In general it requires for its most efficient functioning a specific temperature and pH range.\n\nThe group name of the enzyme usually is compounded from the type of reaction it catalyses (the substance of the reaction being the substrate) suffixed by -ase. Some 650 or more enzymes already have been isolated from plants of which the few following are representative.\n\n\n1. Assimilation.\n\nCarbohydrases (substrate a carbohydrate). e.g. fructosidases (invertase), sucrose to glucose; amylases, starch to maltose and fructose; cellulase, cellulose to cellobiose; nucleosidases, nucleotides to pyrimidine or purine base and ribose.\n\nProteases (peptides and proteins to amino acids and peptides respectively, or (transaminases) transamination of amino acids. e.g. pepsin, protein to polypeptide; papain (protein and polypeptides to amino acids (the animal-derived rennet and trypsin have similar effect)\n\nEsterases (substrate an ester, catalysing e.g. to acid and alcohol) lipases fats to fatty acid and glycerol; phosphorylases, hexose sugars and inorganic phosphates to esters of sugar phosphates.\n\nAmidases (substrate an amido-compound) e.g. urease, urea to ammonia and carbon dioxide.\n\n\n2. Dissimilation.\n\nDehydrogenases, oxidation by removal of hydrogen; carboxylases, e.g. pyruvic acid to acetaldehyde and carbon dioxide. See also co-enzyme, cytochrome.\n\n\nEnzymes extracted from higher plants of economic value include the proteolytic papain from papaya fruit (of Carica papaya) used in control processes of various industries (treatment of hides, tenderising of meat etc.) and clinically (e.g. as an aid to digestive processes); the starch-splitting amylase of malt usually obtained from the germinated seed of barley used in the brewing and distilling industries. Various amylases, proteases, cellulases, pectinases are derived by the fermentation industries from fungi (e.g. the molds and yeasts) and bacteria (e.g. the lactic streptococci) and have a wide range of applications to industrial and clinical fields.

The sclerotium (also called an ergot), or over-wintering stage of the fungus, eventually falls to the ground to remain until late spring or early summer when it germinates. Germination involves the formation of several pin-like structures (stromata) within the head of which are a number of cavities, each cavity containing an ascogonium and an antheridium. With breakdown of the intervening walls, fusion of female and male nuclei developed within these structures ensues, and this is followed by development of a fruiting-body, perithecium, with certain cells (asci) forming ascospores. The ascospores may be carried by wind or other means to young florets whose infection promotes a flow of a sugary liquid ('honey dew') giving the characteristic stickiness to the inflorescences of the grass. The 'honeydew' contains innumerable summer spores (conidia) which may be dispersed by physical contact; its ingestion by cattle leads to a paralyzing disease.\n\nErgot of pharmacology, derived initially from sclerotia formed in rye infected by Claviceps purpurea, contains a number of peptide-like alkaloids chiefly of the groups ergotamine and ergotoxin and derivatives of lysergic acid - these have clinical uses, especially in gynaecology."

        "id": 12290,
        "term": "Essential Oil",
        "meaning": "a volatile (ethereal), aromatic, usually liquid secretion of certain plants stored in various regions, sometimes emulsified within vacuoles or cytoplasm but more generally within cavities (oil glands) formed by the break-down or separation of cells, occasionally in semi-solid form in combination with resins as an oleo-resin. Such oil-bearing plants occur throughout the kingdom, often with a particular concentration in certain families (e.g. of angiosperms, Compositae, Labiatae, Lauraceae, Myrtaceae, Rutaceae, Cruciferae etc.). The significance of the oil to the plant is unknown but evidence suggests it may form a reserve pool from which certain components may be withdrawn as required, e.g. by freeing through catalytic reactions. Other suggestions include that it is a by-product without further concern to metabolism, that it has allelopathic or bacteriostatic qualities of advantage to survival of the plant storing it, that it may help to regulate water-loss by modification of the immediate atmosphere external to the plant through its vapour pressure. Very little is known of its nature in vivo, however.\n\nChemically, the essential oil is a complex mixture with principal constituents referable chiefly to the terpenic group but its manner of synthesis is not known. The oil may be of different nature e.g. the cyanogenic alkyl isothiocyanate occurring with glycosides of mustard oils (e.g. of the seeds of Brassica nigra, source of the mustard of commerce), or a sulphur derivative such as methyl sulphide of the oil of onion and alkyl sulphide of oil of garlic. When of the terpenic group may be a hydrocarbon (e.g. the terpenes cymene, limonene, phellandrene, pinene) or an oxidation product of a hydrocarbon, e.g. an alcohol (citronellol, eudesmol, geraniol, menthol, nerolidol, terpineol) or an ester of the alcohol with an aliphatic or aromatic acid (e.g. geranyl acetate), an aldehyde (e.g. citronellal, citral), a ketone (eg. thujone), a phenol (e.g. thymol, eugenol), or an ether (e.g. cineole.).\n\nThe commerce of essential oils had its origin in the Orient (chiefly Egypt, Persia, India), was probably introduced to Europe in the 14th century, and by 1600 methods of extraction had been developed for, e.g. oils of turpentine, juniper, rosemary, spike lavender, sandalwood. While the principal method of extraction is by distillation with steam, other methods are extraction by solvent e.g. lard or tallow (the enfleurage of the precious flower oil industry) and extraction with alcohol to form a concrete, or a volatile organic solvent e.g. petroleum ether), or expression by pressure methods. Steam has the advantage that it is selective for the oil but the disadvantages that nothing is known of the possible changes during the destructive process and that high-boiling fractions may not 'come-over'. Much of the demand has come from the perfumer (the term 'essential' having come from the use of the oil as an essential of compounded perfumes) and the manufacturer of soaps, disinfectants and detergents; some oils are in demand as flavouring agents or as various pharmaceutical preparations.\n\nWhile the Australian flora is rich in oil-bearing species (e.g. of Eucalyptus, Melaleuca, Leptospermum, Backhousia, Baeckea, Boronia, Eriostemon, Santalum, Eremophila etc.) very few of their oils have reached or maintained commercial interest. These few oils, their principal uses and sources including the following steam-distilled from foliage with the exception of sandalwood (distilled from the the heartwood).\n\n\n(1) as constituents of disinfectants, deodorants, detergents, or solvents (industrial oils)./n/nPiperitone (also used in synthesis of thymol and menthol) and phellandrene: chemical forms of Eucalyptus radiata and E. dives (respectively the Narrow-leaved and Broad-leaved Peppermints).\n\n\n(ii) as blending or fortifying agents of perfumes, or perfumed soaps and other pharmaceuticals (perfumery oils).\n\ncitral: Eucalyptus staigeriana (the Lemon-scented Ironbark of tropical Queensland), Leptospermum petersonii (Lemon-scented Tea Tree, L.

It is usual for progeny to retain the chemical identity of their parents (hence oil composition has a genetic basis). Research in Australia has concentrated on the selection and establishment of 'elite' trees of known (and desired) characteristics but progress in establishing plantations has been extremely slow. More desirable than present methods is the scientifically-based cropping of lavender at Lilydale, Tasmania which has been developed by expert management to a soundly successful industry. Additional to the problem of competition with oils produced overseas on a more economic basis (the sources including plantations from seed imported of Australian native oil-bearers), the substitution of natural products by chemo-synthesis further reduces the prospects of the industry at the present level."

By hydrolysis through the enzyme group of lipases, may be reduced to the component fatty acids and glycerol.\n\nA fat at normal temperature is either liquid (then a fixed oil) or solid (or semi-solid). When liquid, it may dry on exposure to air rapidly, or very slowly, dependent on its oxygen intake, or it may remain a liquid. Rapidly drying oils form elastic, thin films and, as drying oils, have applications to the paint, lacquer, and varnish industries. The slowly-drying (or semi-drying) oils, the non-drying oils, and the solid fats have uses as food materials, illuminants, soaps, and candles. By special chemical techniques, the physical nature of the fat may be modified, e.g. the non-drying castor oil when dehydrated may be used as a drying oil in addition to sundry applications to leather, linoleum, oilcloth, textiles, etc., and as a hydraulic fluid. Fixed oils may be converted to solid fats by hydrogenation (addition of hydrogen) of their fatty acids, e.g. coconut, cottonseed, peanut, soybean, safflower oils when hydrogenated are used as basic components of margarines.\n\nExamples of fats familiar to Australian commerce include: Drying oils — candlenut (Aleurites moluccana), tung (Aleurites fordii), linseed or flax (Linum usitatissimum), soybean (Glycine max), safflower (Catharmus tinctorius)./n/nSemi-drying oils - corn (Zea mais), cottonseed (Goddypium spp.), sesame (Sesamum indicum), sunflower (Helianthus annuus).\n\nNon-drying oils - olive (Olea europaea), peanut (Arachis hypogaea).\n\nSolid fats - coconut (Cocos nucifera), palm oil (Elaeis guineensis). The two solid fats are derived from the dehusked fruit (of coconut, copra), the others from seed."

The end product is determined both by the nature of the substrate and by the presence or absence of oxygen utilisable as the oxidising agent, e.g. the manipulation and control of the conditions leading to the fermentation of agricultural crops and molasses (a syrupy extract from raw sugar) may produce ethyl or butyl alcohols, acetone, citric or other organic acid, abscorbic acid, riboflavin or other vitamin, lactic acid, or the stock food, ensilage or silage, of high protein value. In the production of soft fibres (jute, hemp), the fermentative action of soil-dwelling bacteria is controlled for the separation of the softer tissues from the bark and fibres (the process of retting). Carbon dioxide may, or may not, be formed. e.g. from yeast, this end-product is used in the baking industry for 'raising the dough', bụt in wine-making where alcohol is the desired end-product, its formation is suppressed except for the sparkling wines.\n\nIn one sense, respiration when anaerobic, a process less efficient than aerobic respiration because of the relatively large amounts of substrate required to produce an equivalent energy output, but undergone by both plant and animal cells when under certain conditions. According to environment, microorganisms when facultative anaerobes may adopt either mode. See also alcohol, cereal, bacterium, fungus, respiration."

        "meaning": "a terrestrial, epiphytic, or aquatic pteridophyte (q.v.), usually perennial, with true roots and leaves, and stem a rhizome creeping or ascending, sometimes arborescent but without a cambium. A representative of a group much diversified and the largest and most complex of the spore-bearing vascular plants. Primarily of warm regions with moist or shaded habitats, in Australia of greatest abundance in the rain forests of the tropical north-east. Its group is considered as at class level (Filicopsida of some authors, Pteridopsida of others), the families listed here are intended to be representative of the broad characters expressed but in view of the currently-active revision, are not inclusive of all ferns occurring in the Commonwealth.\n\nThe initial separation is based on the origin of the sporangium, whether from a single cell (then leptosporangiate) or from a group of cells (eusporangiate). The first group is much the larger, the eusporangiate ferns making up two orders, Ophioglossales and Marattiales, each with a single family. The 'adder's tongue' family Ophioglossaceae almost exclusively is of terrestrial, perennial herbs with short, unbranched, fleshy rhizomes, thick and fleshy roots and single or few leaves. Of its three genera, Australia is represented by Ophioglossum and Botrychium. The leaf is made up by a petiole, a sterile frond, and a fertile lateral part or 'spike' simple and linear in Ophioglossum (hence 'adder's tongue') where the sterile lamina is simple and relatively undivided, and in Botrychium (Parsley or Grape Fern) pinnately divided, the sterile lamina pinnately or palmately divided. Sporangia borne by the spike are large (one or two millimetres), thick-walled, marginal, and fused with the spike in Ophioglossum, marginal and terminal, spherical, and borne on short thick stalks in Botrychium (hence 'grape fern'); dehiscence is by a simple transverse slit. The prothalli (gametophytes) are subterranean, tuber-like, usually long-living, always associated with mycorrhiza.\n\nThe second esporangiate group, the Marattiaceae, have a natural occurrence in Australia only in the tropical north. In general appearance, the members approach more the 'typical' ferns and vary from very small to arborescent and among the largest of ferns. In common with the Ophioglossaceae, the stem is fleshy and stipulate (thin and sheathing in the latter family but in Marattiaceae, thick and fleshy and usually bearing dormant buds at the base persistent as the bases of the petioles).  In common with other ferns, there is circinate (uncoiling) development of the leaves, and sporangia are born on the dorsal side of the lamina. Sporangia are large, thick-walled and arranged in definite clusters (sori) along the veins, rarely with a suggestion of a protective enclosure (indusium) but often fused to varying degree in closed structures (syngania). Prothalli are photosynthetic, thalloid structures associated with mycorrhiza, long-living. Two members of the tropical north-east of Queensland are of special note, Angiopteris evecta and Marattia fraxinea. These have large bi- or tri-pinnate leaves (fronds) twelve or more feet long in Angiopteris which, when fallen, leave behind the petiole-bases to form, with the thick fleshy stipules, a capping to the rhizome, the whole forming a mass almost globular and about three or more feet diameter, with thick, fleshy, cord-like roots.\n\nThe leptosporangiate group (Filicales) is considered to have had a relatively modern origin, the first three families, although not closely related, are the most primitive and bridge the gap between the eusporangiate and leptosporangiate groups. Leaves (or more commonly called fronds) are of a petiole (or stipe) which may be articulated to the rhizome, and a lamina which may be simple, pinnately or palmately divided to segments or lobes, or to entire leaflets (primary pinnae and secondary pinnules when pinnate) or compoundly divided (decompound). Sometimes when pinnate there may be a single leaflet only. The venation may be simple or forked, free when the veins meet the margins of the lamina, reticulate or forming a closed system of mesh-like areoles (aeroli). Development of the frond is from a long-persistent apical meristem, it is coiled at the top and unrolls progressively as the lower part matures (i.e. is circinate), phyllotaxy is spiral or alternate. Frequently the one plant may bear fronds of two kinds (is dimorphic) the difference commonly is between the sterile and fertile fronds, e.g. the broad flat brown scale-leaves (nest-leaves) and the forked, erect green fertile fronds of the Stag or Elk Horns of Platycerium. Deciduous buds often are formed on the fronds.\n\nSporangia develop on the margin of the lamina (or lobe or segment of) or on its dorsal surface, i.e. are marginal in the first case and superficial when on the dorsal surface. Usually they form circular, reniform or linear clusters (sori) on a raised part (receptacle) of the lamina which may become elongate or laterally enlarged, located either over a vein ending or along the back of a vein. When sporangia occur over a large part of the dorsal surface (i.e. are superficial) but not limited to sori, they are described as acrostichoid (i.e. resembling Acrostichum) or, when in a series of sori, form a coenosorus. Sporangia are rounded or flattened, sessile or more usually borne on a stalk (pedicel); the wall is a uniseriate layer of cells often with a crest or band (annulus) unspecialised, transverse or oblique, or vertical and then broken by the pedicel. Sometimes a special opening region (a stomium) is formed by the annulus. The function of the annulus is to open the wall for the release of spores or, when highly developed, to actively disperse them. Maturation of the sporangia within the sorus (or on the frond-segment when not in a sorus) may be simultaneous (the condition then simple), progressive on an elongate receptacle (gradate) or not uniform and then mixed. Dehiscence of the sporangium varies from longitudinal to transverse, the spores are either flattened on two sides (bilateral) or on four sides (tetrahedral), often the wall with tuberculate projections. The sorus often is associated with a protective indusium formed from the lamina which may be an upraised fold or ridge cup-shaped or 2-lipped, lateral scale-like structure, an umbrella-like projection from the pedicel, or a reflexing of the lamina margin to form a covering (in this a false indusium).\n\nThe prothallus is usually thalloid, green, monoecious, with the antheridia and archegonia on the lower side, the archegonia on a thickened central cushion or ridge, the antheridia not so localised.\n\nStipules are absent from the rhizome, but flat scales (sometimes clathrate) and hairs, reddish-brown or rusty, often are present.\n\n\nOsmundaceae: (Todea, Osmunda, Leptopteris) Royal Ferns. Terrestrial, with trunk (e.g. the arborescent Todea barbara) or rhizome erect, without scales. Fronds pinnate, large (up to six feet or more in Todea), uniform or dimorphic. Sporangia simple, borne by a short and thick pedicel, not in sori (in Todea superficial along the minor veins, later usually covering the whole of the lower surface of the fertile part of the frond), subglobular, with an annulus no more than a group of thick-walled cells at one end, dehiscing by a deep slit from the apex to the side opposite. Prothallus green, lobed.\n\n\nSchizaeaceae: (e.g. Schizaea, Lygodium). Terrestrial or climbing; rhizome erect or creeping, dichotomously branching, with simple hairs or flattened scales. Fronds simple, dichotomous, bipinnate, or fan-shaped with palmate or pinnate segments, dichotomously veined, with simple hairs or flattened scales. Sporangia large, solitary in 2 to 4 rows, marginal but becoming dorsal by the growth of the lamina segment above and beyond forming a false indusium, sessile or on a lateral segment (sporangiophore), with a cap-like annulus dehiscing by a vertical slit, the annulus with a stomium. Schizaea, a group of small ferns on poor sandy soils, often with a grass-like, sometimes fan-shaped lamina, the petiole wiry. Prothalli of this genus are filamentous, with the gametes being formed in terminal structures on short lateral branches, the archegonia entirely exposed; in other genera the prothallus is thalloid and lobed.\n\n\nGleicheniaceae: (Gleichenia, Sticherus, Dicranopteris). Terrestrial, sometimes xerophytic; rhizome long and creeping, or erect and up to six or more feet high, forked (falsely dichotomous), sparsely hairy or scaled. Fronds large, scrambling and often forming dense clumps or tangled communities, pinnate and falsely dichotomous, hairy or scaled. Sori superficial on unspecialised fronds, usually flattened, rounded and with from one to twelve sporangia borne by a short pedicel, simple in maturation, each sporangium large, broadly pear-shaped, with a complete annulus dehiscing by a longitudinal slit. Sori without an indusium. Prothallus as Osmundaceae.\n\n\nHymenophyllaceae: (e.g. Hymenophyllum, Macroglena, Sphaerocionium). Terrestrial or epiphytic, small, usually in very moist habitats within rainforest. Rhizomes long and creeping, often wiry, sometimes short and thick, hairy. Fronds simple, lobed or divided pinnately or dichotomously, or pinnate usually (except at the veins) of a uniserate layer of cells and almost transparent (hence filmy ferns), without stomata, with or without hairs. Sori marginal, terminal on the ultimate segments of the frond at the tip of a vein which extends into a columnar receptacle, with a tubular, cup-shaped or 2-lipped indusium. Sporangia sessile or on a short pedicel, gradate, with a complete annulus opening by a more or less longitudinal slit. Prothamus thalloid and lobed, filamentous or ribbon-like.\n\n\nCyatheaceae: (e.g. Cyathea, Alsophila). Tree-ferns with erect trunks up to 60 or more feet high, often adventitious roots forming the outerlayer of the trunk. Mostly of rain forest or high rainfall regions, tropical or temperate. Fronds large and palm-like, the lamina decompound, often with chaffy scales. Sori orbicular, superficial, the sporangia on short pedicels, gradate, with a complete annulus dehiscing transversely, with or without an indusium. Prothallus thalloid.\n\nFamilies from Dicksoniaceae to Blechnaceae (once grouped as the Polypodiaceae) have in common: sori with or without a true indusium; sporangia small, borne on slender pedicels; maturation gradate in the first, otherwise mixed; annulus with stomium actively discharging the spores by transverse dehiscence; prothallus thalloid, not lobed, short-lived. There is a frequent occurrence of sterile filaments (paraphyses) within the sporangia, hair-like when simple but developed to umbrella-like, stellate, clathrate or fan-shaped. Spores often with a folded membrane (perispore).\n\n\nDicksoniaceae: (eg. Dicksonia, Culcita. Dennstaedtia).

Mainly epiphytic in rain forest, often large. Rhizome creeping, long or short, with scales. Fronds uniform or dimorphic, the lamina simple, lobed, forked, or pinnate. Sori superficial, ranging from localised to the vein-junctions to covering a section of the lamina, without an indusium. Included is the Elk- or Stag-horn Platycerium bifurcatum, a bracket fern with sterile fronds (scale leaves) forming an enclosure for gravity or wind-drifted moisture-retentive humus.\n\n\nAspidiaceae: (e.g. Polystichum, Lastreopsis, Athyrium). Terrestrial or climbing. Rhizome creeping or erect, with a covering of opaque scales. Fronds uniform or dimorphic, the lamina simple or pinnately divided, decompound or fan-shaped.

Lamina simple, lobed, or more frequently pinnately divided. Sori short, usually in a linear series (coenosorus) borne on veins parallel with the mid-vein (costa) of the frond-segments, with an indusium.\n\n\nThe following are the Water-ferns, unique in that spores are formed in special reproductive structures, sporocarps, and are dimorphic, the mega- and micro-spores forming distinct female and male prothalli. They are the heterosporous ferns. The habitat is aquatic (floating) or semi-aquatic (i.e. rooted in mud).\n\n\nMarsileaceae (e.g. Marsilea). Semi-aquatic, lining permanent and non-permanent fresh-water basins. Rhizome slender or thick and woody, creeping and long, with a covering of hairs, forming roots and developing circinate leaves at the nodes. Lamina with a long petiole, in Marsilea (Nardoo) of 2 pairs of opposite obovate leaflets, in other genera filiform or 2-lobed. Sori in special, usually globular or oblong, tough and strongly protective sporocarps sessile or pedunculate on the petiole, solitary or in numbers.

Sori in groups of two to four on the lower lobe of the first leaf of each branch, enclosed by an indusium, larger when with several microsporangia, smaller when with a solitary megasporangium. Megaspore germinating under water, the prothallus formed never fully free from the spore.\n\n\nEconomic: Apart from the oleoresin obtained from the rhizome of Male Fern Dryopteris felix-mas used as a taenicide (i.e. against tapeworm) overseas, the potential of the group at least in pharmacology is not yet realised. Much use has been made of their ornamental wealth, the commerce from which is not insignificant."

        "id": 13230,
        "term": "Fibre",
        "meaning": "in general, a strand or filament. As a component of a tissue, one of the two cell-types of sclerenchyma (see also sclereid) found within cortex, phloem and xylem (both primary and secondary) of angiosperms, and usually only secondary growth, occasionally cortex, of gymnosperms. It may be scattered or in groups, when in phloem and cortex may be in separate strands or in cylinders, and in monocots may occur as an ensheathment to a vascular bundle. When in secondary xylem is a wood-fibre typically with a much thickened wall to the almost complete occlusion of the lumen, or a fibre-tracheid when resembling a fibre of phloem, the wall very thick and with very small pits.\n\nAs an item of commerce, the term bast fibre refers to a fibre strand when originating from a primary or secondary phloem, a cortex, or the periphery of a vascular bundle (usually then a vascular bundle with associated fibres from the leaf of a monocot) surface fibre when actually a hair from an epidermis or seed-coat, wood-fibre when a fibre strand from secondary xylem. A fibre-strand may be of considerable length, e.g. the bast fibre of manila varies from 6 to 12 feet long, but the staple (i.e. the uniformity in length of a sample) is highly variable. The length of individual fibres also is variable, e.g. 2 to 12 mm. for manila, less than 1 up to 8 mm. for jute and sisal and, as an exceptional case, from 60 to 250 mm. for ramie. While the staple primarily decides the use of bast and surface fibres, other considerations are the length, tensile strength, pliability, durability, and the economic factors governing its production on a commercial scale.\n\nThe economic history of fibre plants began when man first learnt their utility for some of his essential needs, e.g. for binding, netting, shelter construction. Present-day numbers of fibre-yielding plants exceeds 2,000 of which at least 500 are potential commercial species. Most of Australia's local production is for the pulping industries where the wood-fibres of trees both native (e.g. eucalypts) and cultivated (e.g. pines) are used in the making of paper and paper board, and particle and fibre building boards. Of the textile fibres, only cotton and flax have been cropped and milled on a large scale, the potential existing for the establishment of either native or introduced and established fibre-plants but high costs of production in this country impede progress. Some of the commercial bast and surface fibres well-known here are noted below.\n\n\n(a) Soft fibres. i.e. soft but pliable, with or without lignified walls, extracted (by retting) chiefly from dicot stems. Chief usage as fabrics, netting, cordage.\n\nJute: from Corchorus spp. (Family Tiliaceae) especially C. capsularis and C. olitorius, annuals up to 15 feet high. Second only to cotton in utility but production practically confined to small areas in Pakistan and India. Introduced to western commerce circa 1832 but origin very much earlier. Widely used in Australia for wool packs, wheat sacs, and hessians (or burlap).\n\nFlax: source for the textile fibre linen is from Linum usitatissimum (Linaceae). Of ancient and unknown origin but probably later than cotton. Up to recent years grown (in Australia, especially W.A.) for the fibre but the bulk now is for extraction of the fixed oil, linseed, from the seed.\n\nHemp: from the dioecious annual herb Cannabis sativa (Cannabidaceae). The resin extracted from largely the female inflorescences contains isomers of tetrahydrocannabinol with psychoactive effects on man. According to potency, the drug is available as marihuana (or bhang) when of low grade and potency, ganja when of higher quality, and hashish (or charas) when of highest (and most potent) grade. History similar to flax. Native to central and western Asia and widely cultivated, e.g. India, China, Japan.\n\nRamie: from Boehmeria nivea (Urticaceae) chiefly from China and India.\n\nSunn 'Hemp': from Crotalaria juncea (Papilionaceae) chiefly India but grows wild in tropical Australia where introduced.\n\nKenaf: from Hibiscus cannabinus (Malvaceae) chiefly India and Africa.\n\n\n(b) Hard fibres i.e. not necesarily 'harder' than the 'soft fibres' but usually with lignified walls and from the leaves and/or stems of (mainly) tropical or sub-tropical monocots. Chief usage cordage and ropage, matting, sacking.\n\nMania (abaca): from Musa textilis (Musaceae). Sometimes called manila hemp from its entrance to the trade through the port of Manila as a substitute for hemp. Well-known as marine rope.\n\nSisal: from Agave sisalana (Agavaceae). Originating from Mexico but chief production centres are Indonesia and Africa. Mainly cordage, ropage.\n\nNew Zealand Flax: from Phormium tenax (Agavaceae). Cordage and twine, matting.\n\nCoir: from the coconut Cocos nucifera (Palmae). Fibres from the fronds used in textiles, matting, cordage and ropage. Fibres from the husk of the fruit have the necessary stiffness and flexibility for broom and brush making.\n\nBass or Piassava: from the petioles of several palms chiefly the Brazilian Attalea funifera (as Bahia Bass). Broom and brushware.\n\nBassine or Palymra: from petioles of the palm Borassus flabellifer of Ceylon and the eastern coast of India and Burma. Broom and brushware.\n\nMillet Broom or Broom millet: from Sorghum vulgare (Gramineae) widely grown in Australia, originating from Africa and Asia.\n\nRaffia: not strictly a fibre but strips from the leaf-epidermis of the raffia palm Raphia pedunculata (native to Madagascar).\n\nRattan and bamboo: sometimes classed with fibres, are the stems or petioles of the tropical Asian climbing palms of Calamus spp. and the woody Bambusa (Gramineae) respectively.\n\n\n(c) Surface fibres.\n\nCotton: from hairs of the seed-coat of several horticultural strains of Gossypium spp. (Malvaceae), especially the diploid G. herbaceum and G. arboreum, and the tetraploid G. barbadense and G. hirsutum. Originating from India at least 5,000 years ago, a most versatile crop. Of seed or raw cotton, the long fibres (lint) are for fabrics and other textiles as cotton drill and cotton duck, the short fibres (linters) are for medicated cotton and filling material for upholstery. The seed yields an edible fixed oil, the residue (cotton seed cake) a stock food. See also under cellulose.\n\nKapok: the 'floss' from the seed of either Bombax malabarica (Indian Kapok) or Ceiba pentandra (Java Kapok) both trees of the Bombacaceae."
