        "term": "-a",
        "meaning": "A suffix with several uses, e.g. in such latin nouns as alga, Gemma, and latinised nouns as cypsela (from Greek kypsele), the suffix indicates singular number, feminine gender.  When the plural of such nouns is intended, -ae substitutes for -a (hence algae, gamma, cypselae).  When forming the plural of a noun suffixed by -a but of direct origin from the Greek (e.g. chromonema, sterigma, stone), -ata is often the substituting suffix (hence chromonemata, sterigmata, stomata).\n\nFor nouns suffixed by -um to indicate neuter gender, singular number (e.g. bacterium, flagellum, sporangium), a substituted -a forms the plural (hence bacteria, flagella, sporangia). For the nomenclature of taxonomic groups at the levels of division and class, the name-endings recommended by the International Code are phyta and -opsida (e.g. Division Pteridophyta, Class Pter(id)opsida of conservative classifications), the names being treated as neuter plural.\n\nAs an ending to a generic name (a noun in singular number) and a specific epithet (an adjective qualifying the noun) when in agreement in gender, a indicates the feminine, e.g. Angophora costata."

When more than one hydroxyl group are concerned, the alcohol may be dihydric (the glycols), or trihydric (e.g. glycerol or glycerine C₃H₅(OH)₂) or polyhydric.

        "meaning": "(plural algae) a plant which, although rarely differentiated to specialised organs and is in exchange with the environment by superficial diffusion of solutes and gases through unlocalised regions, utilises the energy from sunlight to a greater degree (especially as a component of pelagic plankton) and higher efficiency than the terrestrial plant, and has a physiology in most respects not fundamentally different from plants of higher organisation. Its structure varies from a simple microscopic cell to the complexity of a higher seaweed\n\nIn addition to light-fixing chloroplasts, other plastids, chromatophores, usually provide accessory photosynthetic pigments, the colour often masking the green of chlorophyll. The accessory pigment is either a water-soluble, strongly fluorescent proteinaceous compound, phycobilin, or a carotenoid (q.v.) of an orange or yellow colour. Phycobilins include such pigments as the blue phycocyanin and the rose-red or violet-red phycoerythrin. The pigmentation is a heritable character, fixed early in evolution and possibly deidined by the amount of light energy available to the ancestor at the time; it provides a most useful basis for classification\n\nBlue-green algae: mostly epiphytic plants of soil, fresh water, or seas (e.g. Nostoc and Anabaena of nitrogen-fixation, fresh water plankton, and 'water-bloom'). When unicellular, may be solitary or form filamentous or plate-like colonies, and when multicellular usually forms filaments composed of ensheathed cells (trichomes). In addition to chlorophyll-a and certain carotenoids, the accessory pigment usually is phycocyanin but this may occur also with phycoerythrin, or the latter may occur alone; such pigments never are confined in chromatophores. The 'blue-greens' have certain features of some bacterial groups e.g. a primitive nucleus, reproduction by amitotic cell division, food reserve a starch-like glycogen, enclosure of cells in a gelatinous sheath. In common also is the ability of certain members to reduce atmospheric nitrogen and to withstand temperatures intolerant to most other organisms.\n\nIn recent classificatory schemes, the position of the blue-green algae (as a class Cyanophyceae) is with the bacteria to form a division (Schizophyta). Among algae they are unique in the absence of a highly organised nucleus.\n\nRed algae: in common with the 'blue-greens', the red algae have phycobilins as the pigments accessory to chlorophylls (the chlorophylls are a and d). usually phycoerythrin alone, less frequently phycocyanin with or alone, store a starch (floridean starch) chemically related to glycogen, and are without motile cells. Unlike them, most red algae are sexually reproductive and the pigments are alwavs localised in chromatophores. Life cycles often are complex and unique (e.g. Polysiphonia, Nemalion), with a regular alternation of generations, the generations being almost identical: dioecism also is frequent. Essentially deep water members of tropical to polar seas, predominant of the seaweeds in Australian waters (see also nullipore), some are littoral or above high tide limit where they attach to rocks by disc-like 'hold fasts' or systems of hair-like rhizoids, while others are of fresh water (e.g. Batrachospermum). Fewer again are terrestrial, some of these endozoic. Many are epiphytic (e.g. on kelps) or epizoic (e.g. on hydroids). They range from microscopic and unicellular up to about 2 metres in length, the structure typically a multicellular thallus which may be a simple filament or (more usual) a frond flat or cylindrical, sometimes branched and shrub-like with a stem-like stipe.  As sources of polysaccharides (phycocolloids) are of high economic interest. Phvcocolloids disperse in water to form colloidal systems of use as emulsifying, gelling, and thickening agents. Chieflv Gelidium and Gracilaria spp. for agar, the well known biological culture medium, Chondrus crispus (Irish Moss) and Gigartina spp. for carrageenin, Iridophycus spp. for iridophycin. As a food for human consumption, Porphyra spp. are well known to the 'phycophages' of the orient.\n\nRed algae are treated either as a division Rhodophyta or as a class Rhodophyceae according to the particular scheme.\n\nGreen algae: algae with chloroplasts grass-green from a predominance of chlorophylls a and b largely are of fresh or brackish water or moist soil, but quite a few are marine either as pelagic plankton or attached in the littoral zone. A cell wall of cellulose or pectin is usual, while starch is the principal reserve food. When unicellular, the structure may be simple and microscopic (e.g. Chlorella) or elaborately developed as in the marine Caulerpa where a creeping rhizome-like surculus of indefinite growth develops along its length geotropic rhizoids or holdfasts and assimilatory green fronds of diverse form. Again, the single cell (or coenocyte) may be bladder-like as in some Codium.  When multicellular, single rows of cells may remain simple (as in Spirogyra) or branch as filaments (e.g. Chaetophora), or the filaments may unite laterally to form a single or double-layered membrane (as in the Sea Lettuce Ulva) or a tube simple (Chaetomorpha) or branched (Cladophora). Life cycles throughout show an alternation of generations which may be cytological, only the sporophyte conspicuous (e.g. Codium) and more a feature of those marine or of fresh water periodically exposed to the atmosphere. Often flagellate stages are present. When a morphological difference, the sporophyte and gametophyte may be similar (mainly marine, e.g. Enteromorpha) or the gametophyte dominant, the sporophyte represented by the zygote (fresh water, e.g. Spirogyra, Oedogonium).\n\nGreen algae have received particular attention from the aspect of their highly efficient synthesis of organic compounds, coupled with an adaptability of unicells (e.g. Chlorella) to large-scale culture. Such features have applications to the world food problem in addition to control of carbon dioxide and oxygen exchange e.g. in spacecraft and atomic submarines. Some of the major problems of physiological processes (e.g. photosynthesis) have been elucidated through studies of their group.\n\nModern treatments place the 'greens' as a class, Chlorophyceae, under a division Chlorophyta. The calcium carbonate extracting stoneworts Chara and Nitella of brackish or fresh water have strong links with, or have been derived from, the green algae and have been treated as a second class (Charophyceae) of the Chlorophyte. The stonewort thallus is multicellular and an elaboration of an erect stem-like structure (up to 1 metre long) from which arise verticels of branches; the plant is attached to the soil by rhizoids. Remains of Chara accumulated over a large number of years have led to the formation of limestones.\n\nEuglenoids: some of the most primitive green algae are unicells motile by two flagella (e.g. Chlamydomonas). Also possessing green chloroplasts and a flagellum are the euglenoids, considered as a direct derivation from the flagellate green algae. Euglenoids are asexual unicells lacking a rigid wall and on the threshold of the plant-animal divergence. The reserve food is a starch-like paramylum. A distinctive feature is the invagination (a narrow canal or gullet) of the periplast (the elastic pellicle or outer surface), leading from which is a single (rarely 2) flagellum and at its base a red pigment spot (stigma). Orientation to light is possible through the shading effect of the stigma to a light-sensitive swelling (photoreceptor) at the base of the flagellum. The major genus Euglena has members found in ponds rich in organic matter, others epiphytic on plankton, or endobiotic to plants or animals.\n\nThe status of the euglenoids has been considered divisional (as Euglenophyta).\n\nYellow-green algae and allies: algae with a carotenoid pigment masking the chlorophyll generally are either motile unicells, some with a tendency to form filaments, or non-motile multicells, filamentous and with a tendency to elaborate structure. The first group is of universal distribution, with many members on the threshold of the plant-animal divergence, nutritionally holozoic. The carotenoid pigments, or xanthophylls, differ among the various families but the predominant colours are brown, yellow, or yellow-green. The food reserve is either a starch (or starch-like compound or a polysaccharide, leucosin, in addition to fatty oils. The storage of starch usually is associated with a deposition of cellulose within the cell wall (when present) but there is no tendency to the use of silica, although a sculptured envelope is common. This association is found in the dinoflagellates (the much larger group, the members especially of plankton) and the cryptomonads, both mostly marine.\n\nWith storage of leucosin there is a greater tendency for the cells to form colonies or filaments, or be coenocytic, and when a cell wall is present, silica is the main building substance. The pigment fucoxanthin may be present to give a golden-brown colour, the cell then either flagellate and without a wall (the chrysomonads), or without flagella and with a wall highly silicified and composed of two closely overlapping parts, valves, usually of intricate design (the diatoms, whose fossils have contributed to the formation of petroleum in addition to forming the diatomaceous earths providing the diatomite or kieselguhr of commerce used in filtration, face and polishing powder manufacture, and as an absorbent of nitroglycerine in the manufacture of dynamite). When fucoxanthin is absent, the chromatophores mostly are yellow-green, the plants either unicellular flagellates without cell walls (the chloromonads) or unicellular non-flagellates with cell walls (the yellow-green algae).\n\nOf these diverse groups, present treatment affords divisional status collectively to the dinoflagellates and cryptomonads (Pyrophyta), and to the chrysomonads, diatoms, chloromonads, and yellow-greens (Chrysophyta).\n\nBrown algae: the more complex olive-brown (fucoxanthin) pigmented (additional to chlorophylls a and c) algae possess cell walls of cellulose, commonly store the polysaccharide laminarin and the alcohol mannitol as the food reserves. They form from simple or branched filaments or membranes to multi-layered systems of cells differentiated to internal conducting and storage tissues and external absorbing and assimilating tissues. Life-cycles in the main follow the lines of the green algae, the male gametes being flagellate. Very few of the brown algae are of fresh water; as marine plants mainly of temperate and polar waters, they commonly form marked littoral zones. Many (e.g. Ecklonia, Sargassum, Macrocystis) develop a basal hold-fast, a stem-like stipe bearing leaf-like segments, and a petiole-like inflated vescicle or pneumatocyst which displays the lamina above in vertical position.\n\nProminent among the brown algae are the kelps, a group of the order Laminariales which reach gigantic size (e.g. Macrocystis pyrifera recorded in Australian waters up to 30 metres long) and make up submarine 'forests'. While only Ecklonia and Macrocystis are of general occurrence around the Australian (southern) coast, the kelps overseas have provided sources for iodine, potash, acetone, but present attention is given to the extraction and utilisation of the phycocolloid sodium alginate or align in such diverse fields as foods, drugs, cosmetics, paints, textiles. Although containing more than 95 percent water, the use of kelps as fertilisers is long established. See also coenobium, lichen, photosynthesis."

Thus A. Cunn. ex Benth. indicates that Bentham validly published a name originally proposed by Cunningham but not published by him. When a name has a horticultural origin, Hort. (from hortulanarium) is used before the 'ex'. When a species or lower rank is transferred to another taxon, with or without change of status, its name is retained (unless such name is in use, preoccupied, within the new taxon) and is followed by the author's name in parenthesis, followed by the name of the effecting author. e.g. Grevillea buxifolia (Sm.) R.Br. indicates that for the plant now known by the combination given by Robert Brown, James Smith had published earlier with his diagnosis the name Embothrium buxifolium. When a name with a description, or reference to a description, supplied by one author is published in the work of another author, the word 'in' is used to connect the two. e.g. Eucalyptus alpina Lindl. in Mitch.\n\nWhen desirable to abbreviate the citation, the name of the author supplying the description or effecting a transfer should be retained. e.g. Eucalyptus alpina Lindl., Phyllota phylicoides Benth. (from P. phylicoides (Sieb. ex D.C.) Benth.)."

        "id": 3820,
        "term": "Bacterium",
        "meaning": "(plural bacteria) a micro-organism which, although of definite cellular organisation, has the essential parts of its protoplast undifferentiated (diffuse), not (as in plants of higher levels) limited by complex membranes to organelles. While usually heterotrophic (hence parasitic or saprophytic) from an absence of chlorophyll or other light-fixing pigment, may also be chemoautotrophic by the ability to extract carbon from carbon dioxide through energy derived by the oxidation of inorganic compounds (e.g. of nitrogen, sulphur, iron), or photosynthetic by possession of a type of chlorophyll or other pigment but then strictly anaerobic. Possesses the nucleic acid DNA concentrated in in a more or less definite nucleus (or nuclear apparatus) and, although asexually reproducing, transference of genetic material (simple chromosomes capable of mutating) is possible through a type of conjugation, usually only part of the DNA being transferred on a donor-recipient basis.\n\nThe habitat of the bacterium may be soil, water, air, or host. It may be thermophilic and tolerate (or require) temperatures up to 50°C or more (e.g. Thermomonospora, Thermoactinomyces) or barophilic and withstand pressures up to 600 atmospheres. It may be bioluminescent or diffuse to its medium fluorescent pigments. In some cases, e.g. Clostridium a survival feature is the intracellular development of highly resistant resting-bodies (endospores) which are released on dissolution of the parent cell and may remain viable for many years.\n\nThe organism may remain unicellular or be divided by septa to become multi-cellular and form a trichome. It may be motile by a flagellum or flagella (of a single fibril), by a gliding movement on a solid surface or by a spiralling movement. When unicellular, is typically of the spherical (coccoid), rod-shaped (bacillar), helical or spiral (spirillum) or filamentous form, and may unite with others to form a chain, e.g. Streptococcus with some species forming chains up to 150 microns long, or form clusters, or in a few, a firm-textured gelatinous matrix (zoogloea). The protoplast is limited by a membrane probably of lipoprotein nature, externally lined by a thin, usually rigid, cell-wall probably of cellulose or hemicellulose and possibly with chitin. The cell-wall is enclosed by a slime-layer of a polysaccharide (e.g. galactan) which, when conspicuously developed and in close contact with the cell, forms a capsule. In trichomes, the capsule is replaced by a sheath from which a stalk-like attachment (holdfast) to the surface frequently is developed.\n\nThe nature of the cell-wall provides the basis for the well known but little understood Gram-reaction (first developed by the Danish physician Christian Gram in 1884), the differential staining of the cell by crystal violet (or methyl violet) for a definite period followed by an iodine solution, a decolourising by alcohol and counter-staining by safranin when a resultant blue stain indicates a positive (gram-positive) reaction, and red a gram-negative reaction. The decolourising agent appears prevented entry by a barrier of high lipid content of the Gram-positive wall.\n\nA member of the most primitive group of organisms with an unknown, doubtfully monophyletic origin. Certain bacteria show afinity with the blue green algae (Cyanophyceae or Schizophyceae) and cyrrent classifications place the bacteria as class Schizomycetes with the class Schizophyceae under a common division Schizophyta or Protophyta, the latter division adding the viruses as class Microtatobiotes.  In consideration of the vast field of bacteriology, the following superficial sketch is given to illustrate the diverse nature of this ubiquitous group of organisms.\n\nA.\n\nunicellular, rigid-walled, coccoid, bacillar, or spiral, usually less than 2 microns wide, sometimes in chains, clusters or in zoogloeal masses, usually motile by terminal (polar) flagella, gram-negative. Reproduction by simple transverse fission. -order Pseudomonadales.\n\nIncluded is a sub-order (Rhodobacteriinae) of photo-synthetic anaerobes which oxidise compounds either of sulphur or carbon. When sulphur, carotenoids may mask a chlorophyll to give red and purple colours. The chlorophyll, bacterio-chlorophyll, absorbs from the visible and infra-red spectrum of light. Red and purple sulphur bacteria are strictly anaerobic at least when exposed to light and usually are associated with hydrogen sulphide-containing waters, the sulphide being oxidised to sulphur which is stored within the cell. Forms include the unicellular, motile, encapsuled type (e.g. Chromatium), sometimes colonial, usually about or less than 2 microns wide although the spirally twisted Thiospirillum may be up to 4 microns or more wide and over 40 microns in length.\n\nWhen carotenoids are not prominent, a type of chlorophyll absorbing from the infra-red region gives a green colour, or an unidentified photosynthetic pigment may give a yellowish-green colour. The green sulphur bacteria (e.g. Chlorobium) are unicellular non-motile organisms of marine and fresh water muds, Chlorobium (less than 2 microns wide) oxidising hydrogen sulphide to sulphur which, deposited outside the cell, may be further oxidised to a sulphate by an external outflow of enzymes.\n\nWhen carbon compounds (e.g. alcohols, acetates, lactates) are the hydrogen donors (hydrogen sulphide not being oxidised), colours may be red, purple, or brown, both bacteriochlorophyll and carotenoids being present. Because of a need for organic sources, such coloured bacteria are not strictly autotrophic. The red and purple non-sulphur bacteria (e.g. Rhodopseudomonas) typically are unicellular, less than 2 microns wide, motile and colonial.\n\nWithin the second sub-order (Pseudomonadineae) are the chemoautotrophic bacteria which are colourless, mostly aerobic and using carbon dioxide as the sole source of carbon, usually of soil or water, e.g. the nitrifying bacteria Nitrosomonas and Nitrococcus which oxidise ammonia to nitrate, and Nitrobacter and Nitrocystis which oxidise nitrite to nitrate. In addition, other inorganic compounds are oxidised, e.g. hydrogen to water by Hydrogenomonas, methane by Methanamonas, hydrogen sulphide or a thiosulphate by Thiobacillus (sulphur usually deposited within the cell, ammonia often being used, T. denitrificans in the process reducing nitrate to nitrite), carbon monoxide etc.\n\nThe remainder of the sub-order are heterotrophic and mostly aerobic.  Representative are:-\n\nthe pathogens of plants Pseudomonas (e.g. wilt of potatoes, gummosis of cherry) and Xanthomonas (e.g. leaf scald of sugar cane, leaf spot of cotton), a species of Pseudomonas diffusing a flourescent pigment used as an indicator dye pyocyanin.\n\nacetic acid bacilli (e.g. the aerobic Acetobacter and Acetomonas) which oxidise various organic compounds to organic acids, alcohol to acetic acid, glucose to gluconic or keto-glutonic acid - these are agents of industrial fermentation.\n\nthe marine or fresh-water bioluminescent Photobacterium, sometimes fluorescent Alginomonas, curved bacilli of Gallionella which are attached to a surface by a ribbon-like stalk composed of, or with deposits of iron oxide, Spirillum of stagnant or organically-rich water, with a spiral axis.\n\nsewage purifying bacilli, primary colonisers of the percolating filter (bacterial bed) of sewage disposal as the first stage of its purification, and the alternative system of activated sludge. Zoogloea which gives the name to the colonial form of certain other bacteria.\n\nthe pathogenic members of Vibrio, curved bacilli, e.g. the agent of Asiatic cholera V. comma.\n\nB.\n\n﻿﻿unicellular or multicellular bacilli, heterotrophic, 2 microns or less wide occurring in chains (trichomes) often ensheathed, the sheath usually impregnated with iron or manganese oxides, freeing cells which are either motile or non-motile, gram negative, of fresh water or marine. Chlamydobacteriales. (e.g. Sphaerotilus, Leptothrix).\n\nC.\n\n﻿﻿Cells in dense groups with radiating filaments from the end of which may be formed (budded) a daughter cell (Hyphomicrobium, Rhodomicrobium) or unicellular, ovoid, spherical or pyriform attached at the end of a stalk from a holdfast, budding occurring at the free end of the cell (e.g. Pasteuria), of soil or mud of fresh water. Rhodomicrobium is photosynthetic. Hyphomicrobiales.\n\nD.\n\nunicellular, rigid-walled, coccoid or bacillar, sometimes pleiomorphic, heterotrophic, usually less than 2 microns wide, motile or non-motile, the flagella when present not polar (i.e. are normally peritrichous). Reproduction by transverse fission. Saprophytic, parasitic, often pathogenic, of fresh and salt water, air, soil, animal and plant hosts. Sometimes occurring in chains but not as trichomes. Eubacteriales.\n\nIn this, the major group of bacteria, the following are illustrative.\n\n(i) gram-negative, motile, aerobic bacilli or cocci, free-living in soil, fixing atmospheric nitrogen - Azotobacter (e.g. A. chroococcum).\n\n(ii)gram-negative, motile or non-motile, aerobic bacilli associated with the roots of plants either as symbionts (Rhizobium spp. in the nodules of leguminous plants where nitrogen-fixing) or as pathogens causing malformations (e.g. Agrobacterium tumefaciens causing crown-gall).\n\n(iii)gram-negative bacilli, carbohydrate-fermenting, occurring in alimentary canals either normally commensal (e.g. Escherichia coli, Proteus vulgaris) or pathogenic (causing, e.g. gastroenteritis by species of Salmonella, typhoid fever by S. typhi, dysentery by Shigella spp.), or parasitic on plants causing soft rots (e.g. several species of Erwinia). The entero-bacteria.\n\n(iv)gram-negative aerobic bacilli pathogenic on mammals, e.g. Brucella (brucellosis, undulant fever in man, contagious abortion oi cattle), Haemophilus (e.g. purulent meningitis, infections of the respiratory tract, conjunctivitis), Pasteurella (various septicemias, bubonic and pneumonic plagues by P. pestis).\n\n(v) gram-positive, aerobic cocci.\n\n(a)the lactic acid cocci, homofermenters of carbohydrates to lactic acid, e.g. the chain-forming Streptococcus, some species commonly found in dairy products, sometimes causing the souring of milk, one S. cremoris used in butter and cheese making, others common commensals of the respiratory tract and alimentary canal (a few anaerobic) or pathogenic S. pyogenes producing the toxins associated with scarlet fever and various septicemias.\n\n(b)the cluster-forming micrococci common on, or in, skin and mucous membranes, e.g. Staphylococcus aureus ('golden staph' highly resistant to the normal antibiotics, causative of some bronchopneumonias, food-poisoning (gastro-enteritis), various skin infections.\n\n(vi)gram-negative cocci, kidney-shaped or hemispherical occurring in pairs, non-motile, aerobic, pathogens, e.g. Neisseria gonorrhoeae (gonococcus, causative of gonorrhoea and other venereal diseases). N. meningitidis (meningococcus, an invader of the nasopharynx spreading to the central nervous system to cause a meningitis).\n\n(vii) gram-positive, aerobic, non-sporing bacilli.\n\n(a) ﻿﻿﻿﻿lactic acid bacilli. Fermenters of carbohydrates to lactic acid either almost completely (homofermentative) or with the production of additional compounds as carbon dioxide, ethanol, acetic acid (heterofermentative) Lactobacillus delbrueckii of industrial fermentation, a homofermentative agent converting maltose and dextrose to lactic acid. Commonly occur in fermenting plant (e.g. vegetable and grain mashes, fruit juices) and animal products (e.g. cheese, milk) in association with the yeasts.\n\n(b)the several members of Corynebacterium pathogenic on plants and animals, e.g. C. diphtheriae of diphtheria.\n\n(viii) gram-positive, non-motile, non-sporing anaerobic bacilli normally found in alimentary canals fermenting carbohydrates with the production of carbon dioxide and acetic acid, additionally propionic acid (Propionibacterium) or butyric acid (Butyribacterium).\n\n(ix) endospore-producing bacilli, the endospore often wider than the producing cell which is swollen as a result. Mostly saprophytes of soil, e.g. the aerobic Bacillus (B. subtilis of industrial fermentation producing glycerol, ethanol, lactic acid, and amylolytic, pectolytic and proteolytic enzymes. B. anthracis causative of anthrax, a disease leading to haemorrhagic septicemia), the anaerobic Clostridium, several (e.g. C. butyricum) nitrogen-fixing but many pathogenic. C. tetani and C. botulinum produce a toxin (exotoxin) causing diseases of the nervous system when diffused into the animal body. Unlike C. tetani (tetanus), C. botulinum (botulism) need have no direct contact with the host of its toxin. Butanol, ethanol, acetone and ribofiavin are derivatives from C. acetobutylicum of industrial fermentation.\n\nE.\n\na definite mycelium developed in young stages (the hyphae more or less a micron diameter) which may break up into segments, sometimes branched (Nocardia, Actinomyces), or remain intact and (e.g. Streptomyces) produce spores (conidia) at the ends of aerial hyphae (conidiophores) or other spores (sporangiospores) formed by fragmentation or segmentation of hyphae (sporangia). In Mycobacterium, a mycelium is either poorly or not developed, no spores are formed but a multicellular nature is suspected. Gram-positive, mostly of soil, heterotrophic. Actinomycetales.\n\nSome pathogens of animals and plants (e.g. the aerobes of Nocardia and anaerobes of Streptomyces), several streptomyces sources of antibiotics, e.g. streptomycin used in treatment of tuberculosis from S. griseus, aureomycin from S. aureofaciens, chloramphenicol from S. venezuela, etc. S. scabies causative of Common Scab of potatoes.\n\nThe gram-stain resistant tubercle bacilli of Mycobacterium include M. tuberculosis, and the agent of leprosy M. leprae.\n\nThermoactinomyces includes thermophilic (e.g. an optimum 60°C) agents of humus-formation.\n\nF.\n\nmulticellular filaments (trichomes) sometimes up to 2,000 microns, not enclosed in a sheath, frequently motile, often forming endospores, with a Feulgen reactive (i.e. DNA positive) disc-shaped central nuclear apparatus, heterotrophic, of decomposing organic matter, water, intestines. Caryophanales (Caryophanon, Simonsiella etc.).\n\nG.\n\noccurring in trichomes, sometimes unicellular, motile not by flagella but by a gliding or rolling motion when in contact with a solid substrate hence with a fexible wall, cell width up to 70 microns. Marine, fresh water, soil, or decomposing organic matter, heterotrophic. Beggiatoales (e.g. Beggiatoa, Thiothrix).\n\nH.\n\nvegetative cells bacillar or fusiform, gram-negative, flexible, not flagellate but motile by a slow gliding movement. Colonial in a thin flat plasmodium from the margins of which single cells or groups of cells migrate, usually leaving a trail of slime. Resting cells (sometimes absent) formed singly from a cell which, together with others, are localised in a usually brightly-coloured fruiting-body. Occur in rotting vegetable matter or decaying wood, soil, water both fresh and salt. When marine chitin and agar may be digested; when terrestrial cellulose may be broken down. Slime bacteria (e.g. Cytophaga, Myxococcus, Chondrococcus etc.). Myxobacterales.\n\nI.\n\nflexible, spirally-wound, actively motile but not flagellate, up to 30 microns or more in length, some (e.g. Spirochaetes) with a group of fibrils wound round the main axis and appearing as a single axial filament. Occur as free-living saprophytes of stagnant fresh or salt water, some pathogenic, e.g. the strictly parasitic Treponema pallidum causing syphilis, T. pertenue the tropical disease yaws; Leptospira species causing a jaundice and meningitis bovine leptospirosis affecting cattle and man, Borrelia species relapsing fever. Spirochaetes. Spirochaetales.\n\nJ.\n\n﻿﻿cocci extremely small (up to 300 millimicrons) producing branching filaments up to 50 microns long which later become chains of spherical bodies released by fragmentation, as highly resistant cocci, non-motile, gram-negative. Saprophytic, parasitic or pathogenic. A single genus Mycoplasma causing pleuropneumonias, e.g. M. mycoides contagious pleuropneumonia in cattle. Mycoplasmatales.\n\nK.\n\n﻿﻿Cocci or bacilli (but often pleiomorphic), gram-negative, intermediate in size to the bacteria and the filterable viruses, obligate parasites occurring usually within the cells of vertebrate host or an invertebrate host (e.g. louse, tick) which may be a vector. Classified as an order in association with the Virales (viruses) forming a class Microtatobiotes, the two groups having in common an incapacity for reproduction outside a living cell, but the viruses are far less susceptible to the normal antibiotics. Rickettsiales. e.g. Rickettsia, R. prowazeki the louse-borne agent of scrub typhus. Others, e.g. Anaplasma, are parasites of red blood cells. Miyagawanella spp. certain types of viral pneumonia and the diseases transmissible from birds to man, psittacosis from M. psittaci with hosts psittacine birds, e.g. parrots, and ornithosis from M. ornithosis with hosts usually other than psittacine types but causative of similar disease."

        "meaning": "(phage) a virus dependent on a bacterium for its reproduction. A DNA-containing, protein-coated form spherical in shape when simple but when complex tadpole-like with definite head and tail and up to 200 millimicrons long. While the protein coat is retained on the surface of the bacterial host, the DNA is injected within to take over direction of metabolic processes. This direction may lead to the formation of a number of new phages which are released for infection of other bacterial cells when rupturing (lysis) of the host cell occurs. In other cases, a form of commensalism is known to occur when the phage remains (as a prophage) to cause certain metabolic changes which may lead to an increased degree of resistance or toxicity of the bacterial host."

        "id": 4630,
        "term": "Bryophyte",
        "meaning": "a multicellular, photosynthetic, non-vascular or partially vascular plant, mostly terrestrial, with habit prostrate and thalloid or erect and composed of stem and leaves, attached to a substratum by absorptive capillary-like rhizoids, usually inconspicuous except when in mass. An embryophyte with regular heteromorphic alternation of generations, the diploid (sporophytic) generation never completely independent from the haploid (gametophytic) generation, the sex organs multicellular with the reproductive cells ensheathed by a wall of sterile cells, the female reproductive cell solitary in its archegonium.\n\nA plant generally believed to represent a terrestrial line to dominance of the gametophyte from an ancestor derived from the green algae, the other line represented by the vascular plant with the sporophyte the dominant phase. Its classification embraces three classes, hornworts (Anthocerotae), liverworts (Hepaticae) and mosses (Musci).\n\nThe macroscopic plant, the gametophyte, normally developed from a spore, bears multicellular antheridia (producing flagellate male gametes) and archegonia (producing within each an egg cell). Fertilisation requires moist conditions, the fusion of the motile gamete with the egg-cell leads to the development of an embryo from which arises the sporophyte (a sporogonium) usually enveloped by a sheath or calyptra formed by enlargement of the venter of the archegonium. The mature sporogonium is composed of a spore-bearing structure (capsule) and a basal absorbing part, a foot. Meiotic division of spore mother-cells forms the tetrads of spores which are released on rupture of the capsule, dispersed by wind or water, and develop under moist conditions to new gametophytes. In many liverworts and hornworts, elongated sterile cells, elaters, formed within the capsule concurrently with spores, aid in dispersal through a hygroscopic sensitivity. Gametophytes may be developed also from separated parts or from bud-like gemmae.\n\n\nHornworts\n\nIn this group, a simple thallus develops dorsiventrally and has within each cell a large chloroplast, part of which is a region of protein (a pyrenoid) asociated with the formation of starch. Rhizoidsare unicellular. The origin of sex organs is from internal cells of the dorsal surface of the thallus, the archegonia almost completely embedded. Growth from the archegonial region forms a sheath through which pushes the apex of the capsule. The sporogonium is complex and elongates to an indefinite length from active division of a meristematic region between foot and capsule. It has a central axis (columella) of sterile cells encircled by the spore-bearing tissue, chloroplasts and often stomata. Two genera of note are the widespread Anthoceros with thallus lobed or crisped on the margin bearing on its ventral surface mucilage cavities containing colonies of the blue-green alga Nostoc, and the tropical epiphytic Dendroceros with thallus a single cell in thickness but with a large thick mid-rib projecting below.\n\nThe much larger groups of liverworts and mosses differ from the hornworts by the greater number of chloroplasts (without pyrenoids) within each cell, the origin of the sex organs from superficial cells, and the absence of a meristematic region at the foot of the capsule. Rhizoids of liverworts are unicellular (hence comparable to root-hairs of vascular plants) but in mosses are chains of single cells. Archegonia of mosses and some leafy liverworts are formed at the tip of the stem or its branches, thus arresting further growth from these points (the acrogynous condition), or in other leafy liverworts (of the anacrogynous condition) from other than an apical cell and without arrest of growth. Both archegonia and antheridia may occur on the same plant (the plant then homothallic) or on different plants (then heterothallic or dioecious). When homothallic, the plant is paroecious when both organs occur on the same branch but are segregated, autoecious when occurring on different branches, and synoecious when intermixed on the same branch. Leaves (when present) subtending these organs often are different in shape and size from other leaves and are referred to as perichaetal when distinguishing them from foliage leaves. Of the sporogonium, a connective seta of capsule and foot is usual which, by elongation, pushes the capsule through the calyptra on maturation of the spores (liverworts) or at an early stage in the development of the embryo (mosses).\n\n\nLiverworts\n\nDevelopment of the liverwort from a spore is dorsiventral, leading to a usually dichotomously branched thallus or (a majority) a branched foliose stem. Sex organs develop from single initial cells on the dorsal or anterior surface. The capsule is without a columella but usually develops elaters. While a few liverworts are aquatic (e.g. Riccia fluitans) and a few others can withstand periodic desiccation, the common habitat is a shaded moist site. Some are epiphytes, others epiphylls. Greatest representation of the several orders is from the tropical northern hemisphere but the orders Marchantiales (e.g. Marchantia, Riccia) and Jungermanniales are well represented in Australia. Sex organs of Marchantia are borne on stalked, 'umbrella-like' branches archegoniophores and antheridiophores) but in Riccia these organs occur directly on the dorsal surface of the thallus. For the Jungermanniales, the origin of archegonia may be either anacrogynous (e.g. Ricardia, Pallavicinia) or acrogynous (e.g. Porella, Plagiochila). Growth from the gametophytic tissue close to the archegonium produces a tissue, an involucre, which ensheaths the calyptra of the young sporophyte. When anacrogynous, the plant usually is undifferentiated to stem and leaves, the sexual organs borne laterally and on the dorsal surface of short lateral branches of the thallus. When acrogynous, the plant is foliose, usually with three rows of leaves along a stem, the antheridia globular, borne on long stalks and axillary to the leaves. Leaves subtending sex organs are termed bracts, those below archegonia perichaetal bracts and those below antheridia perigonial bracts. A few of the uppermost perichaetal bracts are fused to form a perianth which encloses the capsule.\n\n\nThe Mosses\n\nGreatest specialisation and diversity are shown by this major group. Distribution is wide with some favour for the colder regions of the world. Germination of a spore leads to a filamentous or thalloid (Sphagnum) protonema which usually dies after formation of an erect branch, a gametophore, bearing the sex organs. The gametophore arises from the protonema as a lateral bud which develops a pyramidal apical cell, division at each face of the cell (cutting face) forming a leaf so that, in most, a branch with three vertical rows of leaves is built. On these leafy branches are borne the sex organs. Rhizoids of both protonema and gametophore are multicellular. The leaves are spirally and symmetrically arranged on a stem composed of a central cylinder, cortex, and epidermis. Development of archegonia is acrogynous. The capsule is without elaters but usually with a columnella, and (except in Andraea) an apical cap, an operculum.\n\nThree groups make up the mosses - bog (or peat) mosses (sub-class Sphagnobrya), granite mosses (sub-class Andreaobrya) and true mosses (sub-class Eubrya).\n\nThe bog mosses (Sphagnum) frequently cover large tracts of swampy lands. There is an abundance of water-absorbing large hyaline cells in contrast with relatively few chlorophyll-bearing cells. A single gametophore is produced from the thallus, archegonia in a terminal cluster, the antheridia axillary to the leaves. The sporogonium is composed of a large globular capsule with a neck-like connective at its base representing a seta, and a bulbous foot. The function of the seta is taken over by an elongation (a pseudopodium) formed from the axis of the branch.\n\nGranite mosses (Andraea, Neuroloma) usually occur on siliceous rocks of arctic or alpine regions. The gametophores usually bear the sex organs in terminal groups on separate branches. The sporogonium is similar to that of Sphagnum except that the capsule is enclosed by a calyptra and dehisces through four valves.\n\nTrue mosses (e.g. Dawsonia, Funaria, Polytrichum) represent the peak of the bryophyte's evolutionary development. They have universal occurrence in habitats ranging from rock faces to ponds to tree trunks. In addition to the filamentous protonema, constant features include a sporogonium with an elongated seta, a capsule photosynthetic and often with stomates internally differentiated to several tissues and opening by an operculum which overlies a hygroscopically sensitive tissue, a peristome, of aid in the control of spore-dispersal.\n\nThe role of the moss and other bryophytes as early colonisers of barren sites and the power to bind soil against erosion are of recognised economic importance. Sphagnum among other mosses contributes to formation of peat, this compressed and carbonised residue has yielded materials and products ranging over fuel, ethyl alcohol, nitrogen source, paper and insulating material, a moisture-retentive medium for plant propagation (additional to Sphagnum from an actively-growing source), and the root-penetrable seedling container commonly known as the 'jiffy-pot'."

    {
        "id": 6040,
        "term": "Cereal",
        "meaning": "a grass yielding grain of value as food for stock or man. Commonly cultivated and the chief parents of the domesticated strains are barley (Hordeum vulgare), maize (Zea mais), millet - white (Panicum miliaceum), Hungarian (Setaria italica), Japanese (Echinochloa frumentacea), oats (Avena byzantina, A. sativa), rice (Oryza sativa), rye (Secale cereale, sorghum (Sorghum spp), wheat (Triticum aestivum, T. durum).\n\nGrain refers to the fruit (a caryopsis) sometimes (barley, oats, rice) including the persistent 'hull' or 'husk' formed by the fused bracts (lemma and palea) of the floret. 'Kernel' also refers to the fruit (the 'groat' of oats) considered of two parts, bran (which includes the pericarp, testa and endosperm) and the germ (the embryo which generally forms a small basal swelling).\n\nWheat, barley and rice have been a staple source of food for a period predating history. At present, about two billion people are almost completely dependent on grain crops for subsistence, the food (while providing adequate calorific value) lacks certain amino acids (e.g. lysine) vital to an optimum diet for humans. Grain yields both carbohydrate and protein (rice, while yielding on a unit acreage basis the highest of cereals in calorific value, has the least protein), the carbohydrate making up about 80 percent of the grain has a particular concentration (chiefly as starch) in the endosperm, the protein is particularly abundant in the germ. Present also in the grain are fatty derivatives (e.g. phospholipids and fixed oils), vitamins of the B complex (e.g. thiamine, nicotinic acid, riboflavin), minerals (chiefy as phosphates and sulphates of potassium, magnesium and calcium).\n\nProcessing of the grain for consumption involves essentially the conversion of the starch to a digestible form as, e.g. the pre-cooked breakfast cereals and cereal stock feeds, porridge from oatmeal, boiled rice. Other processes may involve the removal of husk by abrasion and polishing, e.g. pearl barley, polished rice from 'paddy' or raw rice. The controlled, gradual grinding and sieving to a specified fineness of the separated endosperm (i.e. the milling of grain from wheat, rye, maize, barley) produces a white flour or meal. Certain flours and meals (viz. wheat and rye) possess two proteins, protamin and glutelin, which form with water a gluten with elastic and flow properties and an ability to ferment (activation by yeast) necessary for bread-making. By far wheat is the major source of grain for bread and other baked products, its selection of strain determined by its milling and baking qualities in addition to its response, as a crop, to local geographic conditions.\n\nStrains of wheat are termed 'hard' when their milled endosperm yields a coarse and gritty, free-flowing flour mostly of entire cells, soft when the milled product is very much finer with a tendency of the fragmented cells and free starch to combine. On the baking quality (or strength), a 'strong' wheat denotes a suitability for bread-making with a high protein content, 'weak' when more suitable for biscuit and cake making, or self-raising flour, when a coarse open crumb structure and relatively low protein content render it unsuitable for bread.  Coarse particles from the milling are used (as a semolina) in the processing of macaroni, sphagetti, and vermicilli.\n\nBarley grain provides a meal used as stock feed but is of particular importance in the fermentation and distilling industries - the production from the grain mash (which may include also grain of maize and rye except in beer and stout making) of alcohol through the processes of malting (involving germination of the grain to a malt for the activation by enzymes of starch) and brewing (the fermentation of the malt, or wort in beer-making by yeast through sugar to alcohol) and distillation of the fermented product to pure alcohol, or by various treatments (e.g. the addition of hops from Humulus lupulus to the mash in beer-making) to beer, stout, whiskey. Other products include furfural (used in various industrial processes, e.g. as a solvent), acetone, butanol, and riboflavin.\n\nThe cereal crop may be for grazing (rye, maize, sorghum, millet), for hay (oats, rye, maize, millet, sorghum) or silage. The millets provide grain as a human food in certain of the developing countries and birdseed to the muchbetter endowed; broom millet supplies the fibre for the well-known millet brooms."

Only (a) shows at photosynthesis the fluorescence normally involved in the process and indicating dissipated ('unused') energy, hence (a) is recognised as the sole carrier during photosynthetic reactions of energy absorbed by itself directly and from other photoactive pigments present.\n\nThe molecule of chlorophyll is composed of a complex cyclic structure (four pyrrole rings) within which is a single atom of magnesium, and a long straight chain (a terpenic alcohol, phytol). The phytol, and the magnesium atom (replaced in haem by iron), distinguish it from the colouring matter of vertebrate blood which forms, with the protein globin, haemoglobin. Both chlorophyll and haem are typed as metallic compounds of porphyrin groups. When extracted by a fat-solvent (e.g. alcohol), chlorophyll (a) appears blue-green in incident light with a red fluorescence, is optically active (laevorotatory) but loses much of its photochemical activity.

    },
    {
        "id": 7810,
        "term": "Conifer",
        "meaning": "a seed-bearing, usually monoecious, vascular plant, in habit a tree often tall, excurrent or fastigiate, or a shrub sometimes (e.g. Microcachrys) weakly-branched and straggling, with leaves evergreen, spirally-arranged, whorled or clustered, scale-like, needle-like, or narrow in form. Its male reproductive structure is cone-like, usually much smaller than the female, composed of an axis bearing spirally-arranged sporophylls, each sporophyll with two or more pollen-sacs (sporangia) within which is developed pollen-grain, usually the pollen produced in profusion and carried to the female by wind currents. The female or ovulate structure is composed essentially of a scale (ovuliferous scale) frequently occurring in a spirally-arranged or whorled series to form ultimately a woody cone. On the surface of the scale are borne one or more ovules, unenclosed except by a single integument.\n\nClassification: a member of the class Conopsida of some authors or class Coniferae of others, with orders Cordaitales, Ginkgoales, Taxales, and Coniferales.\n\nThe Cordaitales are known only from the fossil-record and conceivably are the ancestral line to conifers. Ginkgoales, based on the maidenhair tree Ginkgo biloba of China, possibly the oldest surviving seed-bearing plant, virtually extinct in the wild but frequently cultivated, have in common multi-veined broad and flat leaves and motile (male) gametes. These features are absent in the Taxales, an order unique in that no cone is evident either from fossil ancestors or present-day members (the taxads, including the yews of Taxus, and Torreya e.g. California nutmeg Torreya californica). The male structure is a whorled series of radially-symmetrical sporophylls (each with 4-6 pollen-sacs) and sterile scales, the female is solitary in the axils of foliage leaves or leaf-scales and composed of an axis from which arises a cup-like aril enclosing a single erect ovule. Not always is the female structure a cone in the major order, Coniferales, but here, from anatomic comparative studies of fossils and extant members, morphological reduction is implied.\n\nPodocarpaceae, Cephalotaxacae: of the two exceptional families of Coniferales, the ovule (and seed) either is subtended by a scale-like bract sometimes fleshy, or bears an aril often coloured and enclosing it, solitary in Podocarpaceae, paired in Cephalotaxacae (the plum-yews of eastern Asia). The Podocarpaceae have a particular distribution in the southern hemisphere and are represented in Australia by 7 of the 100 or so species of the monoecious Podocarpus mainly in rain forest e.g. Brown Plum P. elatus, Black Pine P. amarus, 1 of the 16 species of Dacrydium, the timber and essential oil yielding D. franklinii confined to Tasmania and now occurring in stands too inaccessible for present exploitation, two monotypic genera also confined to Tasmania, the shrubby Microcachrys tetragona and the timber tree Celery Top Pine Phyllocladus asplenifolius, finally two isolated species of Microstrobos, one (M. niphophilus) in Tasmania, one (M. fitzgeraldii) in New South Wales, both very local and at high altitudes. The New Zealand Dacrydium cupressinum provides the timber Rimu.\n\nCupressaceae: in other families of Coniferales there is rarer modification in the female cone. This is chiefly in the Cupressaceae where the fruit is fleshy and berry-like in the junipers, and small, rounded and with whorled scales in the cypresses (the fruit of both known sometimes as a galbulus). For this family both cone-scales and leaves are in whorls of two or more, the leaves frequently stem-appressed and scale-like. Callitris of 16 species has 14 endemic to Australia ranging from coast to inland, providing the cypress pine of the timber industry (viz. from C. hugelii) and the resin sandarac from the bark of C. verrucosa. Actinostrobos of two shrubby species is endemic to south-western Australia and the monotypic Diselma (D. archeri, a shrub) endemic to Tasmania. Widely cultivated throughout the continent and originating from the northern hemisphere are the cypresses (Cupressus), False Cypress (Chamaecyparis), thujas or Arbor Vitaes (Thuja) and the junipers. Juniperus communis of Europe provides fruit ('juniper berries') used, e.g., in gin-making and for extraction of an essential oil 'oil of juniper'. Tetraclinis articulata of north and north-west Africa, and Spain, yields the resin sandarac from its bark. Thuja plicata of North America provides the timber Western Red Cedar.\n\nAraucariaceae: the spiral arrangement of cone-scales and leaves is the rule in the remaining families of Coniferales. The seed may be solitary on the cone-scale and often embedded, the scale fused with the subtending bract, as in the Araucariaceae where the leaves predominantly are broad and flat (viz. Agathis) or awl-shaped and angled (some Araucaria). The Kauri Pines of Agathis are dispersed throughout the lands of the south Pacific, 3 of the 15 species being endemic to eastern Queensland. Araucaria of 10 species has 2 endemic to the tropical and sub-tropical eastern coast, Bunya Pine A. bidwillii and the more extensive Hoop Pine A. cunninghamii which reaches as far south as the Hastings River of New South Wales. Much cultivated along the eastern seaboard is Norfolk Island Pine A. excelsa. A. klinkii of New Guinea (Klinki Pine) and A. angustifolia of South America (Parana Pine) are sources of well-known timbers.\n\nPinaceae: the seed may be two per cone-scale (Pinaceae) or several (Taxodiaceae), the two families of the northern hemisphere with no natural representation in Australia. The value of the pines as timber trees has created their large-scale establishment in plantations (e.g. Pinus radiata, P. pinaster) to augment the depleted and naturally limited softwood timber sources. Overseas, several pines contribute the oleoresin turpentine from which colophony or rosin, oil of turpentine, and terebene are derived, and Stolkholm or Pine Tar. Typical of the pines are the dimorphic leaves and shoots. Normal long shoots bear achlorophyllous scale-leaves, supplementary short shoots axillary to the scale leaves bear 2, 3, or 5 green, needle-like leaves ensheathed at their base by scale-leaves, the short shoot deciduous as a unit and eventually replaced by male cones. In addition to the pines, the cedars (Cedrus), larches (Larix), spruces (Picea), tsugas (Tsuga), firs (Abies), have become parkland and hedgerow trees ubiquitous to the Australian landscape. Abies balsamea, the balsam fir of eastern Canada, yields the oleoresin Canada Balsam. Timbers familiar to Australian commerce include the North American Douglas Fir or Oregon (Pseudotsuga menziesii), Hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla) and the pines Monterey or Radiata (Pinus radiata), Loblolly (P. taeda), Ponderosa (P. ponderosa), Sugar (P. lambertiana), and the Sitka Spruce (Picea sitchensis), the European White Baltic Pine (Picea abies) and Red Baltic (Pinus sylvestris).\n\nTaxodiaceae: features here include the absence of distinct bracts to the cone-scales, the latter flat or shield-like and bearing 2 to 9 ovules, and the frequent dimorphic, narrow or scale-like leaves persistent on branches ultimately deciduous but not, as in Pinus, shed as a short shoot of a single leaf-cluster. World-famous are the Californian redwoods, e.g. Sequoia sempervirens and Sequoiadendron giganteum where heights up to 360 feet are recorded. In common with the famed Metasequoia glyptostroboides, the 'living-fossil' of China (and of the same family), and the bristlecone pines Pinus aristata of North America where stands believed 4,000 or more years old still exist, the redwoods are of great age and reflect their nature as relics from a greater, more extensive, distribution throughout the northern hemisphere during the early Tertiary of the Cainozoic era some 60 million years ago. The only Australian members of the Taxodiaceae are the three species of Athrotaxis endemic to Tasmania, two King Billy Pine A. selaginoides and Pencil Pine A. cupressoides are valuable though depleted timber trees. Well-known from their frequent cultivation are the cryptomerias (Cryptomeria) and taxodiums (Taxodium)."

        "id": 9050,

        "meaning": "a dioecious cone-bearing seed plant which, from its erect usually unbranched trunk (from subterranean to several feet high), often armoured by the persistent bases of petioles, bearing a dense crown of frond-like, pinnately compound leaves, has an appearance intermediate to that of a fern and a palm. In some, the appearance is closer to the ancient seed-ferns (pteridosperms) with which evidence suggests a far greater affinity than with the conifers formerly believed the closest relatives.\n\n The cycad trunk shows little or no secondary growth. The reproductive structure is a cone (not homologous with that of the conifer) either male or female, often very large ('pineapple-like') made up of a number of spirally. arranged cone-scales (sporophylls) except the females in families not Australian. The male cone-scale bears numerous pollen-sacs, the female bears a single marginal pair of ovules when spirally-arranged in a cone (or, when not forming a cone, the ovules marginal and several). The spores are dimorphic, the male (pollen-grain) dispersed by wind but prior to fertilisation develop to multi-flagellate sperm of macroscopic size, the largest spermatozoids of the plant kingdom. The macrospores develop to multi-cellular gametophytes within which, after pollination, ovules (or very much reduced archegonia) are formed, each ovule producing an egg-cell. Ultimate fertilisation leads to the formation of a seed of large size, with endosperm, a three-layered coat, and an embryo with two hypogeal cotyledons.\n\nClassification of the cycad is unsettled. Some authors treat it at divisional level (as Cycadophyta), others as a class (Cycadopsida or Cycadae) with a single order Cycadales. Two monogeneric families Cycadaceae (Cycas) and Stangeriaceae (Stangeria) and a family Zamiaceae of several genera are established. The Australian representation is from 3 of the 8 genera of Zamiaceae, i.e. Lepidozamia, Macrozamia (including the well-known burrawang M. communis), and Bowenia (of tropical Queensland).\n\nStems and seed of cycads provide sources for starch, the sago of commerce while largely from the sago palms of Metroxylon is also derived from certain cycads, both palms and cycads chiefly of Indonesia and the Philippines. Seed of Macrozamia stores a toxin, macrozamin, which may be rendered innocuous by roasting and soaking treatments, a procedure adopted by the aborigines in their preparation of the seed as food. Extraction of starch ana a jelly-like gum from Macrozamia was a small industry in pre-war New South Wales."

        "meaning": "a cymose inflorescence including the monochasium and dichasium and their derivatives, and the pleiochasium when there are more than two lateral branches.\n\nThe monochasium, with a single lateral branch, occurs usually when the leaf arrangement of the stem is alternate. Its derivatives are the helicoid cyme (or bostryx) when the unilateral branch order is repeated from the single lateral branch, and scorpioid cyme (or cincinnus) when branching from the lateral branch is in an alternating series. Modifications based on the occurrence of flowers in a single plane are the rhipidium of the bostryx as shown by members of Iridaceae, and the drepanium of the cincinnus as shown by members of Juncaceae. Derivatives of the monochasium tend to resemble the monopodium of racemose inflorescences (q.v.) but here branches are always axillary to the leaf (or bract) of the main axis, the pseudo-branches of the cyme being opposite to the leaf or bract when present.\n\nWhen both axillary shoots below the terminal flower of the cyme develop, the inflorescence is a dichasium which, by further branching from the lateral branches, becomes a compound dichasium. Various modifications occur, e.g. a false dichotomous cyme may arise by suppression or loss of the terminal flower, a helicoid or scorpioid cyme may arise by suppression or loss of buds on one side. When internodes of a helicoid cyme (both monochasial and dichasial) are so reduced that the flowers appear to arise from a common point, a monochasial or dichasial umbel may result, the latter being the case with a majority of eucalypts."

While none of these features applies to all dicots, there is also no clear separation from the monocotyledon which evidence favours as a derivation from an early dicot stock. Overall similarities and differences support their maintenance as separate classes.\n\nTreated by most authors as a class Dicotyledonae or other authors as sub-class Dicotyledonidae, the tendency has been to establish finer limits for orders and families as relationships become better known. Hutchinson, 1959 provides 80 orders linking about 340 families, some families with one or few members, others with thousands."

For sub-divisions, the suffixes recommendea are -phytina and (for fungi) -mycotina.\n\nIn earlier classifications divisional groups were thallophytes, bryophytes, gymnosperms, and angiosperms but these have lost some significance in the light of better-known relationships. Representative of current concepts is the classification of A. Cronquist (Bot. Rev. 26:4, 1960). Here, two sub-kingdoms proposed, Thallophyta and Embryophyta. Divisions of Thallophyta are Schizophyta (see bacterium), Rhodophyta, Chlorophyta, Euglenophyta, Pyrrophyta, Chrysophyta, Phaeophyta (see alga), and Fungi.  The common ancestor of the thallophytes is believed the bacterium. For the Embryophyta, divisions are Bryophyta (see bryophyte), Psilophyta (see psilopsid), Lepidophyta (see lycopsid), Calamophyta (see sphenopsid), Filicophyta (see fern), Coniferophyta (see gymnosperm), Cycadophyta (see cycad), Anthophyta (see angiosperm). This major group is believed ultimately derived from the thallophytes through the green algae. The psilophytes are considered ancestral or close to the ancestral line of vascular plants."

Its unit is the quantum, the most familiar being the photon of light energy, although some prominence now is given by the physicists to quanta of the atomic nucleus, lepton pairs and mesons. From Gk. energos, working.\n\nEnergy is conceived as the motivating force of all changes of physical and chemical states, all movement, all changes in equilibrium, and is transformable constant. Familiar examples of its forms are kinetic, potential, mechanical, electrical, electromagnetic, radioactive, atomic, thermal, radiant, chemical, etc. Within the atom or molecule, forms of energy are electronic (given by the orbital movement of the electron), vibrational, rotational, the transference of energy here believed to occur only in multiples of quanta. For any mass, energy is considered as of two components, one (free energy) available for conversion to some other form, and unavailable or bound energy measured as entropy. Heat as an accompaniment of all energy conversions represents a dissipation of free energy and an increase in entropy.\n\nThe capacity to conserve free energy from chemical reaction and to re-utilise it is a criterion of the living organism. In living proceses, the biosynthesis of organic compounds with high potential chemical energy from inorganic substances of low energy is fundamental to growth and development. The physical environment provides the raw materials, sunlight the energy source. Through photosynthesis, radiant energy is converted to chemical energy and through respiration this energy is released to be held and controlled by the organic phosphates. The flow of energy has a single pathway to virtually all forms of life."

The complete enzyme is the holo-enzyme when compound, the protein part is the apo-enzyme. Although of high molecular weight, the molecule of an enzyme is small enough to form in water a non-turbid electrolytic solution. As a rule, it has a specificity for a particular group of compounds or a single compound or its part, and can be denatured by heat, irradiation, ultra-violet light etc. In general it requires for its most efficient functioning a specific temperature and pH range.\n\nThe group name of the enzyme usually is compounded from the type of reaction it catalyses (the substance of the reaction being the substrate) suffixed by -ase. Some 650 or more enzymes already have been isolated from plants of which the few following are representative.\n\n\n1. Assimilation.\n\nCarbohydrases (substrate a carbohydrate). e.g. fructosidases (invertase), sucrose to glucose; amylases, starch to maltose and fructose; cellulase, cellulose to cellobiose; nucleosidases, nucleotides to pyrimidine or purine base and ribose.\n\nProteases (peptides and proteins to amino acids and peptides respectively, or (transaminases) transamination of amino acids. e.g. pepsin, protein to polypeptide; papain (protein and polypeptides to amino acids (the animal-derived rennet and trypsin have similar effect)\n\nEsterases (substrate an ester, catalysing e.g. to acid and alcohol) lipases fats to fatty acid and glycerol; phosphorylases, hexose sugars and inorganic phosphates to esters of sugar phosphates.\n\nAmidases (substrate an amido-compound) e.g. urease, urea to ammonia and carbon dioxide.\n\n\n2. Dissimilation.\n\nDehydrogenases, oxidation by removal of hydrogen; carboxylases, e.g. pyruvic acid to acetaldehyde and carbon dioxide. See also co-enzyme, cytochrome.\n\n\nEnzymes extracted from higher plants of economic value include the proteolytic papain from papaya fruit (of Carica papaya) used in control processes of various industries (treatment of hides, tenderising of meat etc.) and clinically (e.g. as an aid to digestive processes); the starch-splitting amylase of malt usually obtained from the germinated seed of barley used in the brewing and distilling industries. Various amylases, proteases, cellulases, pectinases are derived by the fermentation industries from fungi (e.g. the molds and yeasts) and bacteria (e.g. the lactic streptococci) and have a wide range of applications to industrial and clinical fields.

The sclerotium (also called an ergot), or over-wintering stage of the fungus, eventually falls to the ground to remain until late spring or early summer when it germinates. Germination involves the formation of several pin-like structures (stromata) within the head of which are a number of cavities, each cavity containing an ascogonium and an antheridium. With breakdown of the intervening walls, fusion of female and male nuclei developed within these structures ensues, and this is followed by development of a fruiting-body, perithecium, with certain cells (asci) forming ascospores. The ascospores may be carried by wind or other means to young florets whose infection promotes a flow of a sugary liquid ('honey dew') giving the characteristic stickiness to the inflorescences of the grass. The 'honeydew' contains innumerable summer spores (conidia) which may be dispersed by physical contact; its ingestion by cattle leads to a paralyzing disease.\n\nErgot of pharmacology, derived initially from sclerotia formed in rye infected by Claviceps purpurea, contains a number of peptide-like alkaloids chiefly of the groups ergotamine and ergotoxin and derivatives of lysergic acid - these have clinical uses, especially in gynaecology."

        "id": 12290,
        "term": "Essential Oil",
        "meaning": "a volatile (ethereal), aromatic, usually liquid secretion of certain plants stored in various regions, sometimes emulsified within vacuoles or cytoplasm but more generally within cavities (oil glands) formed by the break-down or separation of cells, occasionally in semi-solid form in combination with resins as an oleo-resin. Such oil-bearing plants occur throughout the kingdom, often with a particular concentration in certain families (e.g. of angiosperms, Compositae, Labiatae, Lauraceae, Myrtaceae, Rutaceae, Cruciferae etc.). The significance of the oil to the plant is unknown but evidence suggests it may form a reserve pool from which certain components may be withdrawn as required, e.g. by freeing through catalytic reactions. Other suggestions include that it is a by-product without further concern to metabolism, that it has allelopathic or bacteriostatic qualities of advantage to survival of the plant storing it, that it may help to regulate water-loss by modification of the immediate atmosphere external to the plant through its vapour pressure. Very little is known of its nature in vivo, however.\n\nChemically, the essential oil is a complex mixture with principal constituents referable chiefly to the terpenic group but its manner of synthesis is not known. The oil may be of different nature e.g. the cyanogenic alkyl isothiocyanate occurring with glycosides of mustard oils (e.g. of the seeds of Brassica nigra, source of the mustard of commerce), or a sulphur derivative such as methyl sulphide of the oil of onion and alkyl sulphide of oil of garlic. When of the terpenic group may be a hydrocarbon (e.g. the terpenes cymene, limonene, phellandrene, pinene) or an oxidation product of a hydrocarbon, e.g. an alcohol (citronellol, eudesmol, geraniol, menthol, nerolidol, terpineol) or an ester of the alcohol with an aliphatic or aromatic acid (e.g. geranyl acetate), an aldehyde (e.g. citronellal, citral), a ketone (e.g. thujone), a phenol (e.g. thymol, eugenol), or an ether (e.g. cineole.).\n\nThe commerce of essential oils had its origin in the Orient (chiefly Egypt, Persia, India), was probably introduced to Europe in the 14th century, and by 1600 methods of extraction had been developed for, e.g. oils of turpentine, juniper, rosemary, spike lavender, sandalwood. While the principal method of extraction is by distillation with steam, other methods are extraction by solvent e.g. lard or tallow (the enfleurage of the precious flower oil industry) and extraction with alcohol to form a concrete, or a volatile organic solvent e.g. petroleum ether), or expression by pressure methods. Steam has the advantage that it is selective for the oil but the disadvantages that nothing is known of the possible changes during the destructive process and that high-boiling fractions may not 'come-over'. Much of the demand has come from the perfumer (the term 'essential' having come from the use of the oil as an essential of compounded perfumes) and the manufacturer of soaps, disinfectants and detergents; some oils are in demand as flavouring agents or as various pharmaceutical preparations.\n\nWhile the Australian flora is rich in oil-bearing species (e.g. of Eucalyptus, Melaleuca, Leptospermum, Backhousia, Baeckea, Boronia, Eriostemon, Santalum, Eremophila etc.) very few of their oils have reached or maintained commercial interest. These few oils, their principal uses and sources including the following steam-distilled from foliage with the exception of sandalwood (distilled from the the heartwood).\n\n\n(1) as constituents of disinfectants, deodorants, detergents, or solvents (industrial oils)./n/nPiperitone (also used in synthesis of thymol and menthol) and phellandrene: chemical forms of Eucalyptus radiata and E. dives (respectively the Narrow-leaved and Broad-leaved Peppermints).\n\n\n(ii) as blending or fortifying agents of perfumes, or perfumed soaps and other pharmaceuticals (perfumery oils).\n\ncitral: Eucalyptus staigeriana (the Lemon-scented Ironbark of tropical Queensland), Leptospermum petersonii (Lemon-scented Tea Tree, L.

It is usual for progeny to retain the chemical identity of their parents (hence oil composition has a genetic basis). Research in Australia has concentrated on the selection and establishment of 'elite' trees of known (and desired) characteristics but progress in establishing plantations has been extremely slow. More desirable than present methods is the scientifically-based cropping of lavender at Lilydale, Tasmania which has been developed by expert management to a soundly successful industry. Additional to the problem of competition with oils produced overseas on a more economic basis (the sources including plantations from seed imported of Australian native oil-bearers), the substitution of natural products by chemo-synthesis further reduces the prospects of the industry at the present level."

By hydrolysis through the enzyme group of lipases, may be reduced to the component fatty acids and glycerol.\n\nA fat at normal temperature is either liquid (then a fixed oil) or solid (or semi-solid). When liquid, it may dry on exposure to air rapidly, or very slowly, dependent on its oxygen intake, or it may remain a liquid. Rapidly drying oils form elastic, thin films and, as drying oils, have applications to the paint, lacquer, and varnish industries. The slowly-drying (or semi-drying) oils, the non-drying oils, and the solid fats have uses as food materials, illuminants, soaps, and candles. By special chemical techniques, the physical nature of the fat may be modified, e.g. the non-drying castor oil when dehydrated may be used as a drying oil in addition to sundry applications to leather, linoleum, oilcloth, textiles, etc., and as a hydraulic fluid. Fixed oils may be converted to solid fats by hydrogenation (addition of hydrogen) of their fatty acids, e.g. coconut, cottonseed, peanut, soybean, safflower oils when hydrogenated are used as basic components of margarines.\n\nExamples of fats familiar to Australian commerce include: Drying oils — candlenut (Aleurites moluccana), tung (Aleurites fordii), linseed or flax (Linum usitatissimum), soybean (Glycine max), safflower (Catharmus tinctorius)./n/nSemi-drying oils - corn (Zea mais), cottonseed (Goddypium spp.), sesame (Sesamum indicum), sunflower (Helianthus annuus).\n\nNon-drying oils - olive (Olea europaea), peanut (Arachis hypogaea).\n\nSolid fats - coconut (Cocos nucifera), palm oil (Elaeis guineensis). The two solid fats are derived from the dehusked fruit (of coconut, copra), the others from seed."

The end product is determined both by the nature of the substrate and by the presence or absence of oxygen utilisable as the oxidising agent, e.g. the manipulation and control of the conditions leading to the fermentation of agricultural crops and molasses (a syrupy extract from raw sugar) may produce ethyl or butyl alcohols, acetone, citric or other organic acid, abscorbic acid, riboflavin or other vitamin, lactic acid, or the stock food, ensilage or silage, of high protein value. In the production of soft fibres (jute, hemp), the fermentative action of soil-dwelling bacteria is controlled for the separation of the softer tissues from the bark and fibres (the process of retting). Carbon dioxide may, or may not, be formed. e.g. from yeast, this end-product is used in the baking industry for 'raising the dough', bụt in wine-making where alcohol is the desired end-product, its formation is suppressed except for the sparkling wines.\n\nIn one sense, respiration when anaerobic, a process less efficient than aerobic respiration because of the relatively large amounts of substrate required to produce an equivalent energy output, but undergone by both plant and animal cells when under certain conditions. According to environment, microorganisms when facultative anaerobes may adopt either mode. See also alcohol, cereal, bacterium, fungus, respiration."

        "meaning": "a terrestrial, epiphytic, or aquatic pteridophyte (q.v.), usually perennial, with true roots and leaves, and stem a rhizome creeping or ascending, sometimes arborescent but without a cambium. A representative of a group much diversified and the largest and most complex of the spore-bearing vascular plants. Primarily of warm regions with moist or shaded habitats, in Australia of greatest abundance in the rain forests of the tropical north-east. Its group is considered as at class level (Filicopsida of some authors, Pteridopsida of others), the families listed here are intended to be representative of the broad characters expressed but in view of the currently-active revision, are not inclusive of all ferns occurring in the Commonwealth.\n\nThe initial separation is based on the origin of the sporangium, whether from a single cell (then leptosporangiate) or from a group of cells (eusporangiate). The first group is much the larger, the eusporangiate ferns making up two orders, Ophioglossales and Marattiales, each with a single family. The 'adder's tongue' family Ophioglossaceae almost exclusively is of terrestrial, perennial herbs with short, unbranched, fleshy rhizomes, thick and fleshy roots and single or few leaves. Of its three genera, Australia is represented by Ophioglossum and Botrychium. The leaf is made up by a petiole, a sterile frond, and a fertile lateral part or 'spike' simple and linear in Ophioglossum (hence 'adder's tongue') where the sterile lamina is simple and relatively undivided, and in Botrychium (Parsley or Grape Fern) pinnately divided, the sterile lamina pinnately or palmately divided. Sporangia borne by the spike are large (one or two millimetres), thick-walled, marginal, and fused with the spike in Ophioglossum, marginal and terminal, spherical, and borne on short thick stalks in Botrychium (hence 'grape fern'); dehiscence is by a simple transverse slit. The prothalli (gametophytes) are subterranean, tuber-like, usually long-living, always associated with mycorrhiza.\n\nThe second esporangiate group, the Marattiaceae, have a natural occurrence in Australia only in the tropical north. In general appearance, the members approach more the 'typical' ferns and vary from very small to arborescent and among the largest of ferns. In common with the Ophioglossaceae, the stem is fleshy and stipulate (thin and sheathing in the latter family but in Marattiaceae, thick and fleshy and usually bearing dormant buds at the base persistent as the bases of the petioles).  In common with other ferns, there is circinate (uncoiling) development of the leaves, and sporangia are born on the dorsal side of the lamina. Sporangia are large, thick-walled and arranged in definite clusters (sori) along the veins, rarely with a suggestion of a protective enclosure (indusium) but often fused to varying degree in closed structures (syngania). Prothalli are photosynthetic, thalloid structures associated with mycorrhiza, long-living. Two members of the tropical north-east of Queensland are of special note, Angiopteris evecta and Marattia fraxinea. These have large bi- or tri-pinnate leaves (fronds) twelve or more feet long in Angiopteris which, when fallen, leave behind the petiole-bases to form, with the thick fleshy stipules, a capping to the rhizome, the whole forming a mass almost globular and about three or more feet diameter, with thick, fleshy, cord-like roots.\n\nThe leptosporangiate group (Filicales) is considered to have had a relatively modern origin, the first three families, although not closely related, are the most primitive and bridge the gap between the eusporangiate and leptosporangiate groups. Leaves (or more commonly called fronds) are of a petiole (or stipe) which may be articulated to the rhizome, and a lamina which may be simple, pinnately or palmately divided to segments or lobes, or to entire leaflets (primary pinnae and secondary pinnules when pinnate) or compoundly divided (decompound). Sometimes when pinnate there may be a single leaflet only. The venation may be simple or forked, free when the veins meet the margins of the lamina, reticulate or forming a closed system of mesh-like areoles (aeroli). Development of the frond is from a long-persistent apical meristem, it is coiled at the top and unrolls progressively as the lower part matures (i.e. is circinate), phyllotaxy is spiral or alternate. Frequently the one plant may bear fronds of two kinds (is dimorphic) the difference commonly is between the sterile and fertile fronds, e.g. the broad flat brown scale-leaves (nest-leaves) and the forked, erect green fertile fronds of the Stag or Elk Horns of Platycerium. Deciduous buds often are formed on the fronds.\n\nSporangia develop on the margin of the lamina (or lobe or segment of) or on its dorsal surface, i.e. are marginal in the first case and superficial when on the dorsal surface. Usually they form circular, reniform or linear clusters (sori) on a raised part (receptacle) of the lamina which may become elongate or laterally enlarged, located either over a vein ending or along the back of a vein. When sporangia occur over a large part of the dorsal surface (i.e. are superficial) but not limited to sori, they are described as acrostichoid (i.e. resembling Acrostichum) or, when in a series of sori, form a coenosorus. Sporangia are rounded or flattened, sessile or more usually borne on a stalk (pedicel); the wall is a uniseriate layer of cells often with a crest or band (annulus) unspecialised, transverse or oblique, or vertical and then broken by the pedicel. Sometimes a special opening region (a stomium) is formed by the annulus. The function of the annulus is to open the wall for the release of spores or, when highly developed, to actively disperse them. Maturation of the sporangia within the sorus (or on the frond-segment when not in a sorus) may be simultaneous (the condition then simple), progressive on an elongate receptacle (gradate) or not uniform and then mixed. Dehiscence of the sporangium varies from longitudinal to transverse, the spores are either flattened on two sides (bilateral) or on four sides (tetrahedral), often the wall with tuberculate projections. The sorus often is associated with a protective indusium formed from the lamina which may be an upraised fold or ridge cup-shaped or 2-lipped, lateral scale-like structure, an umbrella-like projection from the pedicel, or a reflexing of the lamina margin to form a covering (in this a false indusium).\n\nThe prothallus is usually thalloid, green, monoecious, with the antheridia and archegonia on the lower side, the archegonia on a thickened central cushion or ridge, the antheridia not so localised.\n\nStipules are absent from the rhizome, but flat scales (sometimes clathrate) and hairs, reddish-brown or rusty, often are present.\n\n\nOsmundaceae: (Todea, Osmunda, Leptopteris) Royal Ferns. Terrestrial, with trunk (e.g. the arborescent Todea barbara) or rhizome erect, without scales. Fronds pinnate, large (up to six feet or more in Todea), uniform or dimorphic. Sporangia simple, borne by a short and thick pedicel, not in sori (in Todea superficial along the minor veins, later usually covering the whole of the lower surface of the fertile part of the frond), subglobular, with an annulus no more than a group of thick-walled cells at one end, dehiscing by a deep slit from the apex to the side opposite. Prothallus green, lobed.\n\n\nSchizaeaceae: (e.g. Schizaea, Lygodium). Terrestrial or climbing; rhizome erect or creeping, dichotomously branching, with simple hairs or flattened scales. Fronds simple, dichotomous, bipinnate, or fan-shaped with palmate or pinnate segments, dichotomously veined, with simple hairs or flattened scales. Sporangia large, solitary in 2 to 4 rows, marginal but becoming dorsal by the growth of the lamina segment above and beyond forming a false indusium, sessile or on a lateral segment (sporangiophore), with a cap-like annulus dehiscing by a vertical slit, the annulus with a stomium. Schizaea, a group of small ferns on poor sandy soils, often with a grass-like, sometimes fan-shaped lamina, the petiole wiry. Prothalli of this genus are filamentous, with the gametes being formed in terminal structures on short lateral branches, the archegonia entirely exposed; in other genera the prothallus is thalloid and lobed.\n\n\nGleicheniaceae: (Gleichenia, Sticherus, Dicranopteris). Terrestrial, sometimes xerophytic; rhizome long and creeping, or erect and up to six or more feet high, forked (falsely dichotomous), sparsely hairy or scaled. Fronds large, scrambling and often forming dense clumps or tangled communities, pinnate and falsely dichotomous, hairy or scaled. Sori superficial on unspecialised fronds, usually flattened, rounded and with from one to twelve sporangia borne by a short pedicel, simple in maturation, each sporangium large, broadly pear-shaped, with a complete annulus dehiscing by a longitudinal slit. Sori without an indusium. Prothallus as Osmundaceae.\n\n\nHymenophyllaceae: (e.g. Hymenophyllum, Macroglena, Sphaerocionium). Terrestrial or epiphytic, small, usually in very moist habitats within rainforest. Rhizomes long and creeping, often wiry, sometimes short and thick, hairy. Fronds simple, lobed or divided pinnately or dichotomously, or pinnate usually (except at the veins) of a uniserate layer of cells and almost transparent (hence filmy ferns), without stomata, with or without hairs. Sori marginal, terminal on the ultimate segments of the frond at the tip of a vein which extends into a columnar receptacle, with a tubular, cup-shaped or 2-lipped indusium. Sporangia sessile or on a short pedicel, gradate, with a complete annulus opening by a more or less longitudinal slit. Prothamus thalloid and lobed, filamentous or ribbon-like.\n\n\nCyatheaceae: (e.g. Cyathea, Alsophila). Tree-ferns with erect trunks up to 60 or more feet high, often adventitious roots forming the outerlayer of the trunk. Mostly of rain forest or high rainfall regions, tropical or temperate. Fronds large and palm-like, the lamina decompound, often with chaffy scales. Sori orbicular, superficial, the sporangia on short pedicels, gradate, with a complete annulus dehiscing transversely, with or without an indusium. Prothallus thalloid.\n\nFamilies from Dicksoniaceae to Blechnaceae (once grouped as the Polypodiaceae) have in common: sori with or without a true indusium; sporangia small, borne on slender pedicels; maturation gradate in the first, otherwise mixed; annulus with stomium actively discharging the spores by transverse dehiscence; prothallus thalloid, not lobed, short-lived. There is a frequent occurrence of sterile filaments (paraphyses) within the sporangia, hair-like when simple but developed to umbrella-like, stellate, clathrate or fan-shaped. Spores often with a folded membrane (perispore).\n\n\nDicksoniaceae: (e.g. Dicksonia, Culcita. Dennstaedtia).

Mainly epiphytic in rain forest, often large. Rhizome creeping, long or short, with scales. Fronds uniform or dimorphic, the lamina simple, lobed, forked, or pinnate. Sori superficial, ranging from localised to the vein-junctions to covering a section of the lamina, without an indusium. Included is the Elk- or Stag-horn Platycerium bifurcatum, a bracket fern with sterile fronds (scale leaves) forming an enclosure for gravity or wind-drifted moisture-retentive humus.\n\n\nAspidiaceae: (e.g. Polystichum, Lastreopsis, Athyrium). Terrestrial or climbing. Rhizome creeping or erect, with a covering of opaque scales. Fronds uniform or dimorphic, the lamina simple or pinnately divided, decompound or fan-shaped.

Lamina simple, lobed, or more frequently pinnately divided. Sori short, usually in a linear series (coenosorus) borne on veins parallel with the mid-vein (costa) of the frond-segments, with an indusium.\n\n\nThe following are the Water-ferns, unique in that spores are formed in special reproductive structures, sporocarps, and are dimorphic, the mega- and micro-spores forming distinct female and male prothalli. They are the heterosporous ferns. The habitat is aquatic (floating) or semi-aquatic (i.e. rooted in mud).\n\n\nMarsileaceae (e.g. Marsilea). Semi-aquatic, lining permanent and non-permanent fresh-water basins. Rhizome slender or thick and woody, creeping and long, with a covering of hairs, forming roots and developing circinate leaves at the nodes. Lamina with a long petiole, in Marsilea (Nardoo) of 2 pairs of opposite obovate leaflets, in other genera filiform or 2-lobed. Sori in special, usually globular or oblong, tough and strongly protective sporocarps sessile or pedunculate on the petiole, solitary or in numbers.

Sori in groups of two to four on the lower lobe of the first leaf of each branch, enclosed by an indusium, larger when with several microsporangia, smaller when with a solitary megasporangium. Megaspore germinating under water, the prothallus formed never fully free from the spore.\n\n\nEconomic: Apart from the oleoresin obtained from the rhizome of Male Fern Dryopteris felix-mas used as a taenicide (i.e. against tapeworm) overseas, the potential of the group at least in pharmacology is not yet realised. Much use has been made of their ornamental wealth, the commerce from which is not insignificant."

        "id": 13230,
        "term": "Fibre",
        "meaning": "in general, a strand or filament. As a component of a tissue, one of the two cell-types of sclerenchyma (see also sclereid) found within cortex, phloem and xylem (both primary and secondary) of angiosperms, and usually only secondary growth, occasionally cortex, of gymnosperms. It may be scattered or in groups, when in phloem and cortex may be in separate strands or in cylinders, and in monocots may occur as an ensheathment to a vascular bundle. When in secondary xylem is a wood-fibre typically with a much thickened wall to the almost complete occlusion of the lumen, or a fibre-tracheid when resembling a fibre of phloem, the wall very thick and with very small pits.\n\nAs an item of commerce, the term bast fibre refers to a fibre strand when originating from a primary or secondary phloem, a cortex, or the periphery of a vascular bundle (usually then a vascular bundle with associated fibres from the leaf of a monocot) surface fibre when actually a hair from an epidermis or seed-coat, wood-fibre when a fibre strand from secondary xylem. A fibre-strand may be of considerable length, e.g. the bast fibre of manila varies from 6 to 12 feet long, but the staple (i.e. the uniformity in length of a sample) is highly variable. The length of individual fibres also is variable, e.g. 2 to 12 mm. for manila, less than 1 up to 8 mm. for jute and sisal and, as an exceptional case, from 60 to 250 mm. for ramie. While the staple primarily decides the use of bast and surface fibres, other considerations are the length, tensile strength, pliability, durability, and the economic factors governing its production on a commercial scale.\n\nThe economic history of fibre plants began when man first learnt their utility for some of his essential needs, e.g. for binding, netting, shelter construction. Present-day numbers of fibre-yielding plants exceeds 2,000 of which at least 500 are potential commercial species. Most of Australia's local production is for the pulping industries where the wood-fibres of trees both native (e.g. eucalypts) and cultivated (e.g. pines) are used in the making of paper and paper board, and particle and fibre building boards. Of the textile fibres, only cotton and flax have been cropped and milled on a large scale, the potential existing for the establishment of either native or introduced and established fibre-plants but high costs of production in this country impede progress. Some of the commercial bast and surface fibres well-known here are noted below.\n\n\n(a) Soft fibres. i.e. soft but pliable, with or without lignified walls, extracted (by retting) chiefly from dicot stems. Chief usage as fabrics, netting, cordage.\n\nJute: from Corchorus spp. (Family Tiliaceae) especially C. capsularis and C. olitorius, annuals up to 15 feet high. Second only to cotton in utility but production practically confined to small areas in Pakistan and India. Introduced to western commerce circa 1832 but origin very much earlier. Widely used in Australia for wool packs, wheat sacs, and hessians (or burlap).\n\nFlax: source for the textile fibre linen is from Linum usitatissimum (Linaceae). Of ancient and unknown origin but probably later than cotton. Up to recent years grown (in Australia, especially W.A.) for the fibre but the bulk now is for extraction of the fixed oil, linseed, from the seed.\n\nHemp: from the dioecious annual herb Cannabis sativa (Cannabidaceae). The resin extracted from largely the female inflorescences contains isomers of tetrahydrocannabinol with psychoactive effects on man. According to potency, the drug is available as marihuana (or bhang) when of low grade and potency, ganja when of higher quality, and hashish (or charas) when of highest (and most potent) grade. History similar to flax. Native to central and western Asia and widely cultivated, e.g. India, China, Japan.\n\nRamie: from Boehmeria nivea (Urticaceae) chiefly from China and India.\n\nSunn 'Hemp': from Crotalaria juncea (Papilionaceae) chiefly India but grows wild in tropical Australia where introduced.\n\nKenaf: from Hibiscus cannabinus (Malvaceae) chiefly India and Africa.\n\n\n(b) Hard fibres i.e. not necesarily 'harder' than the 'soft fibres' but usually with lignified walls and from the leaves and/or stems of (mainly) tropical or sub-tropical monocots. Chief usage cordage and ropage, matting, sacking.\n\nMania (abaca): from Musa textilis (Musaceae). Sometimes called manila hemp from its entrance to the trade through the port of Manila as a substitute for hemp. Well-known as marine rope.\n\nSisal: from Agave sisalana (Agavaceae). Originating from Mexico but chief production centres are Indonesia and Africa. Mainly cordage, ropage.\n\nNew Zealand Flax: from Phormium tenax (Agavaceae). Cordage and twine, matting.\n\nCoir: from the coconut Cocos nucifera (Palmae). Fibres from the fronds used in textiles, matting, cordage and ropage. Fibres from the husk of the fruit have the necessary stiffness and flexibility for broom and brush making.\n\nBass or Piassava: from the petioles of several palms chiefly the Brazilian Attalea funifera (as Bahia Bass). Broom and brushware.\n\nBassine or Palymra: from petioles of the palm Borassus flabellifer of Ceylon and the eastern coast of India and Burma. Broom and brushware.\n\nMillet Broom or Broom millet: from Sorghum vulgare (Gramineae) widely grown in Australia, originating from Africa and Asia.\n\nRaffia: not strictly a fibre but strips from the leaf-epidermis of the raffia palm Raphia pedunculata (native to Madagascar).\n\nRattan and bamboo: sometimes classed with fibres, are the stems or petioles of the tropical Asian climbing palms of Calamus spp. and the woody Bambusa (Gramineae) respectively.\n\n\n(c) Surface fibres.\n\nCotton: from hairs of the seed-coat of several horticultural strains of Gossypium spp. (Malvaceae), especially the diploid G. herbaceum and G. arboreum, and the tetraploid G. barbadense and G. hirsutum. Originating from India at least 5,000 years ago, a most versatile crop. Of seed or raw cotton, the long fibres (lint) are for fabrics and other textiles as cotton drill and cotton duck, the short fibres (linters) are for medicated cotton and filling material for upholstery. The seed yields an edible fixed oil, the residue (cotton seed cake) a stock food. See also under cellulose.\n\nKapok: the 'floss' from the seed of either Bombax malabarica (Indian Kapok) or Ceiba pentandra (Java Kapok) both trees of the Bombacaceae."

    {
        "id": 14250,
        "term": "Fungus",
        "meaning": "(plural fungi) a plant of simple organisation but with well-defined nucleus and genetic system, reproducing sexually by spores or asexually by spores, fragmentation, fission, or budding, obligate to a saprophytic or parasitic mode of nutrition by an absence of light-fixing pigment (i.e. heterotrophic), mainly aerobic and soil-dwelling.\nBecause of its saprophytic or parasitic nature, the fungus in relation to the biosphere is of fundamental importance. On one hand its role in breaking down organic waste is essential in maintaining the balance of environmental factors essential to life. Through the conversion of waste (aided by bacteria), the humus of soil and the carbon dioxide content of the atmosphere are sustained. Associated with an alga to form a lichen, it may be a primary coloniser of a rock surface as the first stage of soil formation. Through an association (a mycorrhiza) with roots of vascular plants, a mutually beneficial nutrient-exchange system appears to be established for at least a number of plants. When parasitic, however, destruction of living organisms reaches alarming levels. Although in relative minority, the various moulds, mildews, blights, anthracnoses, rusts and smuts, and the agents of damping-off, wood-rot, and other decay present problems in the establishment of economic crops and storage of their products. To a lesser extent, the fungus is pathogenic to animals, e.g. as an agent of dermatomycosis, pneumomycosis, otomycosis, certain sometimes fatal deep mycoses as cryptococcosis, various lesions and allergic complaints of the higher animals including man.\nTo industry, the fungus has a diverse utility, e.g. in fermentation including brewing, wine-making and distilling, in the making of bread and cheese, the production of alcohols. To pharmacology it is the source of certain antibiotics (e.g. the aspergillins, penicillins, citrinin), vitamins (e.g. riboflavin, biotin, thiamin), organic acids (e.g. citric, gallic, gluconic), enzymes (e.g. invertase, amylase, pectinase, and the cellulose digesting enzyme systems). Several mushrooms, morels and truffles, and yeasts provide foods, the yeasts especially have been considered sources of fats. An ability to synthesise protein from carbohydrate and inorganic nitrogen has suggested a possible means of converting rice and other available carbohydrate sources of protein-starved populations. As a biological tool, the fungus receives wide application in techniques concerning biosynthesis, genetics, physiology.\nClassification. The true position of the fungus in the Plant kingdom and its affinity with the bacterium remain inconclusively answered. Its evolution and inter-relationships are unknowns, although a polyphyletic origin appears most probable. Modern treatments recognise a division, Mycota, which includes two subdivisions Myxomycotina (slime moulds) and Eumycotina (true fungi). The following brief sketch is given to illustrate the gross features of the major groups.\nThe slime moulds (Class Myxomycetes). Vegetative (somatic) phase a usually coloured plasmodium (i.e. a multi-nucleate protoplast enclosed by an ultra-thin flexible membrane) motile by a creeping and flowing (amoeboid) movement. Nutrition phagocytic, hence the group sometimes considered with the Protozoa of the animal kingdom. When mature and under certain environmental conditions, the plasmodium is converted wholly to usually coloured intricately-designed fruiting-bodies (sporangia) within which meiotic division initiates the formation of a number of haploid, thick-walled, non-motile resistant spores. Each spore germinates to an amoeboid cell, either a non-motile myxamoeba or a uni- or bi-flagellate swarm-cell, nutritionally phagocytic. Fusion of two myxamoebae or two swarm-cells (which eventually lose flagella) results in a diploid zygote which, by repeated mitotic division, forms a diploid multinucleate plasmodium. Under unfavourable environmental conditions, survival is possible by the conversion of the plasmodium to a hardened resting-body, a sclerotium.\nA majority of myxomycetes (sub-class Myxogastromycetidae) forms spores fully enclosed by the outer wall (peridium) of the sporangium but a small group (sub-class Ceratiomyxomycetidae) of a single genus Ceratiomyxa of one or two species bear spores unenclosed by a common wall. Members of the class are world-wide in distribution, mainly associated with decomposing plant material under moist conditions. The peridium of the Australia-occurring Physarum, Fuligo, Didymium is calcareous.\nOther slime moulds. Two orders of uncertain affinity also are known as slime moulds. These are the Acrasiales (the cellular slime moulds) and the Labyrinthulales (the net slime moulds). The somatic phase of the former is a free-living myxamoeba and the typical reproductive phase a colony (pseudoplasmodium) of myxamoebae which is converted to a fruiting-body (sorocarp) consisting of, when simple, a stalk which carries at its tip the spores in a group. The cellular slime moulds are soil-dwellers, bacteria-feeding, perhaps with greater affinity with the Protozoa. The most widespread genus is Polysphondylium.\nThe somatic phase of the net slime mould is a simple oval or spindle-like amoeboid cell which secretes a mucus. This mucus forms a filament which, in contact with others formed in the same way, fashions the net along which division of the cells occurs. Most are marine or fresh-water saprophytes or phagocytes apparently confined to the northern hemisphere, e.g. Labyrinthula.\nThe True Fungi (Eumycotina). The thallus varies from a single cell (e.g. the yeasts) to a multicellular, branched, filamentous mass (a mycelium of hyphae) developing a sometimes conspicuous fruiting-body (e.g. the mushrooms and bracket fungi). The cell wall often has the polysaccharide chitin the main component, usually with some cellulose and sometimes with callose. Nutrition is by direct absorption of part of the substrate made soluble by a previous outflow of enzymes through the cell wall when saprophytic, but when parasitic usually absorbing directly through the cell wall of the host (or from its protoplast when penetrating the wall), often producing absorbing outgrowths (haustoria) from the hyphae which invade a host's tissue.\nSpores borne asexually are produced within sporangia (the spores then sporangiospores) or at the ends or sides of hyphae (the spores then conidia). Sexual reproduction involves essentially the union of two protoplasts (plasmogamy) with haploid nuclei, fusion of the two nuclei (karyogamy) to form a diploid zygote nucleus, meiotic division of the zygote and restoration of the haploid condition in the four daughter nuclei resultant of the division. When terrestrial, spores are dispersed chiefly through air-currents and animal carriers. Their germination (when hypha-forming) is by production of a tube-like outgrowth (a germ-tube) which elongates to a filament (a hypha).\nDifferentiation of the 9,000 odd genera is based on the reproductive stage.\n\n1. The sporangium fungi. Three groups representing the traditional Phycomycetes, a class now in disfavour because of its heterogenous nature. The first group appears to provide a link with the slime moulds but its true position is unsettled. The second and third groups represent sub-classes Oomycetidae and Zygomycetidae, the latter accepted as a natural group (and given by some the status of a class). The Oomycetidae are separated into orders on the basis of the type of flagellum, but these orders appear as classes in some recent classifications.\ni. Plasmodial endoparasites. Vegetative phase a plasmodium developed within the host. Asexually reproductive by either motile spores (zoospores) formed within motile sporangia (zoosporangia) or by cleavage of the plasmodium into resting-spores which germinate to swarm-cells. Both swarm-cells and zoospores (as is the case of the swarm-cells of the biflagellate Myxomycetes) with two unequal flagella of whiplash type produced at the fore (anterior ) end of the cell, but differ from the myxomycetes in that no fruiting-bodies are formed for the production of resting-spores. Obligate endoparasites of vascular plants, algae and fungi, causing excessive development (hypertrophy) of tissues or cells, e.g. Plasmodiophora brassicae causing club rot of Brassica spp., Spongospora subterranea causing scab of potatoes. A single order and family. Order Plasmodiophorales.\n\n2. Chytrids, water moulds, downy mildews, white rusts.\nThallus coenocytic, a single cell or a pseudo or true mycelium. Asexually reproductive by zoospores formed within motile or non-motile sporangia. When the case, sexually reproductive by fusion of like (isogamous) or, more commonly, unlike (anisogamous) flagellate gametes (planogametes), by fusion of a motile gamete (antherozoid or sperm) with a non-motile egg (oosphere) to form a usually thick-walled resting spore (an oospore) or by contact of two gametangia, the nucleus of one migrating to and fusing with the nucleus of the other.\nA. Zoospores and planogametes uniflagellate, the flagellum produced from the after (posterior) end of the cell and of whiplash type.\n(i) Thallus unicellular or produced to a branched filamentous anchoring and absorbing system of rhizoids or, when more advanced, the system resembling a true mycelium, i.e. forming a rhizomycelium. Where known, sexual reproduction by a variety of methods but resulting in a resting spore or a thick-walled resistant sporangium. Habitat aquatic or of soil, several parasitic on vascular plants, e.g. Physoderma zeaemaydis causing Brown Spot of maize, Synchytrium endobioticum causing hyperplasia (warting) of potatoes. The chytrids. Order Chytridales.\n(ii) Thallus a true mycelium. Sexual reproduction where known by fusion of planogametes: resistant sporangia formed. Aquatic or of soil. (Allomyces, Blastocladia, etc.). Order Blastocladiales.\n(iii) Thallus a true mycelium. Sexual reproduction by fusion of a sperm with a non-motile egg to form a thick-walled oospore; no resistant sporangia being formed. Mostly aquatic. (Gonapodya, Monoblepharis etc.). Order Monoblepharidales.\nB. Zoospores uniflagellate, the flagellum produced from the fore end of the cell, of tinsel type. Sexual reproduction not known with certainty. Members, though few in numbers, diverse and with features of other orders. Fresh water or marine. (Hyphochytrium, Rhizidiomyces etc.). Order Hyphochytrium.\nC Zoospores biflagellate, one flagellum directed backwards and of whiplash type, the other directed forwards and of tinsel type.\n(i) Thallus unicellular or filamentous. When unicellular wholly converted, and when filamentous the filament divided by septa into cells some or all converted, to sporangia or gametangia (i.e. the thallus holocarpic). Sexually reproductive by union (sometimes through a conjugation tube of gametangia, usually by the migration and fusion of the male protoplast to and with the female, to form a thick-walled resting spore. Aquatic. parasitic within plant or animal hosts. (Lagena, Lagenidium etc.). Order Lagenidales.\n(11) Thallus when primitive unicellular and with a rhizoidal system, holocarpic, but for most a well-developed mycelium with a rhizoidal system (holdfast) only part of which is converted for reproduction (i.e. the thallus eucarpic). Cell wall of cellulose. Sexual reproduction by union of gametangia to form oospores (except when primitive), the gametangia (antheridia and oogonia) developed by the same (homothallic) mycelium or by different (heterothallic) mycelia, when homothallic on the same or different hyphae. Soil or water-dwelling saprophytes, or parasites of plants (e.g. Aphanomyces) or small animals (e.g. Saprolegnia with a species parasitising fish and their roe). The water moulds, some producing conspicuous mycelia. Order Saprolegniales.\n(iii) Features of the previous order but differing in the septum-like plug of a carbohydrate (identified as cellulin) occurring at constrictions along the hyphae. The few members are saprophytes of soil or water. (Leptomyces, Sapromyces etc.). Order Leptomitales.\n(iv) Mycelium well-developed, often with an absorbing host-penetrating haustorium. Sporangia typically rounded, in the more advanced borne on sporangiophores deciduous at maturity, in some cases germinating directly without formation of zoospores (i.e. the sporangium functioning as a spore) but zoospores formed in most. Sexual reproduction through antheridia and oogonia on the same or different hyphae, the oogonium bearing a single oospore. Aquatic, or of soll and then often pathogenic to vascular plants, e.g. Pythium debaryanum a causative of damping-off of seedlings and Root Rot of wheat, Phytophthora infestans. Late Blight of potatoes, P. cinnamomii Root Rot of conifers, P. parasitica Downy Mildew of crucifers, Brown Rot of potatoes etc., the downy mildews of the family Peronosporaceae, obligate parasites including Plasmophora viticola infesting grapes, Peronospora tabacina Blue Mould of tobacco, P. trifoliorum of lucerne and the White Rusts of Albugo, e.g. A. candida of crucifers. Order Peronosporales.\n\n3 Bread moulds, insect-parasitisers.\nThallus a mycelium coenocytic or at first coenocytic but becoming septate producing non-motile asexual spores either from sporangia or as conidia. Sexually reproductive by the complete fusion of two gametangia borne by the same or different mycelia and morphologically identical, the product a resting spore, (zygospore).\n(i) Mycelium well-developed. Asexual spores aplanospores formed in terminal sporangia or sometimes in reduced sporangia (sporangioles) which function as conidia. Rarely without sexual reproduction. Of soil or plant debris, mainly as saprophytes, e.g. Rhizopus stolonifer (R. nigricans), the common bread mould, used by the fermentation industry for production of fumaric acid, R. oryzae for alcohol, and other species for lactic acid. Some, e.g. Mucor, Absidia, parasitic on other fungi, higher plants, or animals. Order Mucorales.\n(ii) Mycelium not usually well-developed, at some stage often becoming septate and fragmenting to hyphal bodies. Asexual reproduction by sporangioles functioning as conidia, or by true conidia borne on, and effectively discharged from, conidiophores. Where known, sexual reproduction by fusion of hyphal cells or hyphal bodies to form zygospores; sometimes without fusion but forming morphologically similar azygospores. Chiefly parasites of insects, some saprophytic, e.g. the fly fungus Entomophthora muscae, a saprophyte of dead flies. Basidiobolus ranarum has been isolated from subcutaneous lesions of man. Order Entomophthorales.\n(iii) Mycelium slender, often forming a host-penetrating haustorium. True conidia formed but not discharged. Sexual reproduction as in previous order. Parasites of lower animals of water or soil. (Acaulopage, Zoopage etc.). Order Zoopagales.\n\nII. The sac fungi. Thallus a single cell, a chain of cells, or (more usually) a septate mycelium, the cell wall of chitin as the main component. Asexual spores conidia (summer spores) borne in conidiophores, but asexual reproduction also may be by fission, budding, fragmentation, or spores other than conidia, none of which is flagellate. Sexual spores ascospores formed by fusion of nuclei from an antheridium and the female gametangium, an ascogonium, usually in definite number in sac-like asci (singular ascus) borne, except when primitive or degenerate, in a fruiting-body, an ascocarp.\nMycelium (especially when forming a fruiting-body or sclerotium) sometimes organised into a definite tissue, prosenchyma when of open texture, pseudoparenchyma when of closed texture, i.e. the hyphae have lost their individual identity.\nUnlike the previous groups (usually known as the Lower Fungi) where fusion of male and female nuclei occurs soon after contact, nuclei of the sac fungi remain in close association without fusion but separately undergoing several sucessive divisions to form usually a number of bi-nucleate (dikaryotic) cells. Within the mother-cell of the ascus, fusion of nuclei eventually occurs, the resultant (diploid) zygote undergoing meiosis to produce four haploid nuclei. A further division is mitotic so that eight haploid nuclei (typically) are shared equally by eight ascospores produced within the ascus.\nSaprophytes and parasites of water, both fresh and salt, soil, and a variety of other habitats. Class Ascomycetes.\n\nA. Mycelium often absent or poorly developed. No specialised hyphae (ascogenous hyphae) or ascocarps formed. Sub-class Hemiascomycetidae.\n(i) Ascus arising directly from the zygote formed by the union of two cells, or parthenogenetically from a single cell. Order Endomycetales. The yeasts. To distinguish the yeasts (Saccharomycetes) included in this order from those yeasts not known to produce ascopores, the name sporogenous yeasts may be applied. Predominantly unicellular, asexual reproduction is by a process of budding, growth of a new cell from an outgrowth of a parent. The daughter cell by constriction at the base may become separate from the parent or itself may share a divided nucleus with an outgrowth of its protoplast which, again by enlargement and constriction, forms a new cell but without separation, the budding process continued so that a chain (sometimes branched) may be developed. A transverse wall may be formed also after division of a nucleus of a parent cell, the fission resulting in two cells, or both fission and budding may occur. The cell so formed is a blastospore.\nYeasts are universal in occurrence and of major importance to the fermentation industries (e.g. brewing and baking) from their ability to ferment carbohydrates (e.g. Saccharomycetes cerevisiae). Their high content of protein, fats, vitamins of the B group, and the economic nature of their large-scale culture favour the provision of a supplementary food for the human diet.\n(ii) Mycelium developed, the hyphae penetrating the vascular plant on which parasitic. Cells typically binucleate. Asexually reproducing by a process of budding from ascospores to form uninucleate, haploid, yeast-like blastospores. Ascus arising from an ascogenous cell.\nA single family and (probably) genus, Taphrina with members causing leaf-curls, witches brooms and various malformations of economic plants, e.g. T. deformans causing Leaf Curl of stone fruits. Order Taphrinales.\n\nB. The second sub-class Euascomycetidae constitute a vastly diverse group with unsettled inter-relationships. For convenience rather than as a taxonomic treatment, four sub-groups (or series) have been presented, the nature of the ascocarp providing the basic distinction.\n(i) Moulds and powdery mildews. Asci globular or ovoid, produced at different levels (or in Erysiphales in a single basal layer at maturity) and short-lived within the ascocarp, the ascopores released on dissolution or (Erysiphales) bursting. Ascocarp without an opening (hence termed a cleistothecium) or with a neck-like structure (ostiole) terminating in a pore.\nIncluded are some members of form-genera Aspergillus (e.g. Eurotium, Sartorya) and Penicillium (e.g. Carpenteles, Talaromyces) with known perfect state (see Deuteromycetes following). Ceratocystis includes many pathogens of economic crops (e.g. C. paradoxa causing a disease of pineapples) and causatives of Blue Stain of timber.\nThe order Erysiphales represents a group of powdery mildews often pathogenic to economic plants, e.g. Erysiphe graminis of cereals, Podosphaera leucotricha of apples, Uncinula necator of vines, Sphaerotheca spp. of several crops. Series Plectomycetes.\n(ii) Asci clavate or cylindric, borne in a layer (hymenium) lining the base (and often the sides) of the inner wall of the ascocarp, usually persistent. Ascocarp closed by a true wall except for a pore formed by an ostiole through which escape the ascospores (the ascocarp termed a perithecium), the neck of the ostiole lined by a fringe of short hair-like structures (periphyses).\nTwo of the orders are of especial interest, one (Sphaerales) of many pathogens of economic crops and ornamentals, e.g. Rossellinia spp. causing various rots, Gnomonia pathogenic on north temperate trees, Glomerella cingulata causing Ripe and Target Spot of Apples. The other order, Hypocreales, includes Gibberella fujikuroi a pathogen of several crops (rice, maize, cotton etc.) and the original source of the growth substances, the gibberellins. Claviceps purpurea (order Clavicipetales) is a pathogen of cereals and other grasses, and the source of ergot. The larvae-parasitic Cordyceps of the same order cause the curious 'vegetable caterpillars' created by the fruiting-bodies arising from the 'consumed' host. Series Pyrenomycetes.\n(iii) Cup fungi, morels and truffles.\nAsci clavate or cylindric, borne in a hymenium of an open (unwalled) ascocarp (an apothecium). Ascocarp often highly coloured, of varied shape, and three-layered with a superficial hymenium with asci and paraphyses, an underlying thin layer of interwoven hyphae (a hypo-thecium), and a main supporting fleshy part (excipulum). Ascospores released from their asci through an apical pore or a lid-like operculum, or a longitudinal slit, in the two latter cases discharged with some force.\nThe operculate cup fungi of the order Pezizales are of interest for their conspicuous cup-like apothecia formed by several of its saprophytic members, e.g. Morchella with several species throughout Australia. Morchella, and Tuber (of the order Tuberales) provide the morels and truffles respectively, highly prized in Europe as items of food. The truffles are produced and mature below ground-level.\nSeveral plant pathogens are included by the Helotiales, e.g. Diplocarpon earliana causing Leaf Scorch of strawberries, Pseudopeziza medicaginis Leaf Spot of lucerne, Sclerotinia homeocarpa Dollar Spot of pastures, Sclerotinia trifoliorum Clover Rot. Series Discomycetes.\n(iv) Asci clavate, in clusters borne in minute stalked perithecia, short-lived. Thallus usually a simple filament with a basal foot serving as an anchor to the surface of its obligate host, an insect or arachnid. Many widespread members (Laboulbenia, Ceratomyces etc). Series Laboulbeniomycetes.\n(v) Bitunicate, stromatic fungi.\nAsci with a double wall (i.e. bitunicate), a rigid outer wall which breaks at maturity below its top to reveal an extended inner wall. Ascospores forcibly ejected through a pore at the apex of the inner wall. Ascocarp an ascostroma, i.e. formed within and composed of a cushion-like tissue, a stroma within cavities of which are borne the asci.\nWithin the group are several pathogens of economic plants, e.g. (order Myriangiales) Elsinoe ampelina Black Spot of vines, E. fawcettii citrus scab, E. veneta anthracnose of berry fruits: (order Dothideales) Mycosphaerella brassicola Leaf Spot of crucifers, M. linarum Pasmo of linseed, M. pinodes Blight of Peas, Ophiobolus graminis Take all of wheat: (order Pleosporales) Venturia inequalis Black Spot of apples, V. pirini Black Spot of pears. Series Loculoascomycetes.\n\n\nIII. The imperfect fungi.\nSexual reproduction unknown (not observed, or not a faculty of the fungus) but the hyphae septate and (except for a section) with reproduction by conidia, hence either an ascomycete or (more rarely) a basidiomycete. Since the asexual state is known as the imperfect state, the group known as the Fungi Imperfecti, or the form-class Deuteromycetes. To indicate that the name may be changed when sexual reproduction is observed, the categories are prefixed by form, e.g. form-genus, form-species. This name may still be used when the perfect state becomes known but it implies the conidial state only, e.g. form-genus Aspergillus has perfect states referrea to genera Eurotium, Emericella, Sartorya. All members of these genera, however, need not have the Aspergillus state.\nConidia usually are borne on conidiophores of various forms but, in some, arise from a structure, a pycnidium, resembling the perithecium of an ascomycete and, in others, the conidiophores may form a closely packed, cushion-like cluster, often with bristle-like setae (the structure known as an acervulus). When conidia are borne by pycidia, the fungi are referred to form-order Sphaeropsidales, a number of its members being important pathogens of economic crops, e.g. Ascochyta, Phoma, Septoria causing spotting of several fruits, Phomopsis citri melanose of citrus, Diplodia maydis rot of maize, Phoma foveata gangrene of stored potatoes. Far greater in economic importance is the form-order Moniliales (with over 10,000 form-species) covering fungi reproducing by budding (e.g. the 'false yeasts') or by means other than through pycnidia or acervuli.\nTo the Moniliales are assigned fungi of concern to human pathology, e.g. the agents of dermatomycoses (as ringworm, tinea, athlete's foot') and deeper mycoses which are sometimes fatal, e.g. cryptococcosis by Cryptococcosis neotormans, a false yeast which may aftect the central nervous system or cause lesions of the lungs. Another false yeast (so-called from a non-production of ascospores) is Candida albicans a saprophyte of the mouth which may cause thrush and lesions of the mouth and intestines. The form-genera Aspergillus and Penicillium unassigned to Plectomycetes which have received considerable attention for their part in biochemical synthesis, e.g. production of cheese, gluconic acid, various enzymes, antibiotics, and conversions of various organic compounds. Some strains are associated with food spoilage and various infections of man and animals, e.g. certain strains of Aspergillus flavus associated with peanuts produce powerful toxins (aflatoxins). Of importance as pathogens of economic crops in Australia are the form-genera Alternaria, Botrytis, Clasterosporium, Cercospora, Curvularia, Fusarium, Helminthosporium, Kabatiella, Nigrospora, Polyspora, Rhynchosporium, Thielaviopsis, Verticillium.\nThe anthracnose (characterised by localised lesions, necrosis and hyperplasia) of plants are due largely to members of the order Melanconiales e.g. Gloeosporium and Colletotrichum which form conidia in acervuli. Rhizoctonia (the soil-dwelling 'damping-off' fungi) and Sclerotium (causatives of various rots) are assigned to the Mycelia sterilia since there is no known reproductive state, i.e. the thallus alone is known.\n\n\nIV. The basidia fungi.\nNo gametangia formed (except when primitive or reduced), karyogamy occurring within a typically clavate structure, a basidium (plural basidia) usually within (in number) a fruiting-body (basidiocarp). Basidium originating as a single binucleate septate cell of a hypha, its two nuclei fusing at karyogamy to form a zygote which divides meiotically. Outgrowths, sterigmata, (singular sterigma) typically four in number and appearing as stalked cells projected from the basidium and within which the nuclei (usually a tetrad) of the meiotically-divided zygote migrate. Basidiospores arising from these nuclei generally uninucleate haploid cells which, when mature, are forcibly ejected from the sterigmata and dispersed by air currents.\nGermination of a basidiospore leading to a septate mycelium of uninucleate cells, a primary mycelium. In most, a secondary, and in the higher members, a tertiary mycelium formed, the secondary arising from the primary e.g. by the fusion of two uninucleate cells with independent division of nuclei but without formation of a cross-wall (septum), the cell thus formed binucleate (dikaryotic). Commonly at division of a binucleate cell to form two new binucleate cells, a hook-like bridging outgrowth, a clamp-connection developed between two nuclei, one of the pairs of daughter nuclei from a divided parent migrating through the clamp-connection. Through this medium, the original parent nuclei are duplicated and distributed within the two new cells.\nTissues (prosenchyma and pseudoparenchyma) commonly formed (fruiting-bodies, sclerotia) as in previous class. Asexual reproduction by budding, fragmentation, or by conidia or other types of spores. Class Basidiomycetes.\nOn the type of basidium developed, the class is subdivided to:-\nA. Basidium septate or longitudinally divided, or developed directly from a thick-walled resting spore (teleutospore) within which karyogamy occurs, a short tube being produced on which basidiospores are formed. Basidiospores usually germinating to secondary basidiospores.\nJelly fungi, rusts, smuts. Sub-class Heterobasidiomycetidae.\nB. Basidium not septate, typically clavate.\nMushrooms, toadstools, bracket fungi, puffballs, earth-stars. Sub-class Homobasidiomycetidae.\n\nA. Jelly fungi, Rusts, Smuts.\nThe fruiting-body (basidiocarp) may be well-developed (order Tremellales) or poorly or not at all developed (Uredinales, Ustilaginales). The first order is mainly of saprophytes with fruiting-bodies usually gelatinous (hence 'jelly' or 'trembling' fungi) but also waxy or cartilaginous, often coloured. (Tremella, Dacromyces, Calocera etc.).\nThe teleutospore-forming orders Uredinales (the rusts) and Ustilaginales (the smuts) have complex life-cycles. The rusts bear spores on sterigmata from which they are forciby ejected when mature, but spores of smuts are sessile and not ejected. Both are of high importance as pathogens of economic crops, the genera significant to Australian agriculture including the rusts Puccinia, Melampspora, Uromyces, Phragmidium, and the smuts Ustilago, Tilletia, Urocystis, Sphacelotheca.\n\nB. Within the Homobasidiomycetidae are the most conspicuous and familiar of fungi, conspicuous not so much from their mycelia but from their fruiting-bodies. There are two major groups which differ in the manner of their development of basidia, the Hymenomycetes where formed in a layer, a hymenium, which may at first be covered by a tissue (a veil) but is open during the early formation of the basidiospores, and the Gasteromycetes where, in this series, the hymenium is not open, i.e. is enclosed by a peridium, the spores freed at the break-down of the fruiting-body. The tissue making up the hymenium-bearing structure is known as a trama (plural tramae). A small section (an order Exobasidiales of some authors, a family Exobasidiaceae of others) has no fruiting-body, the hymenium covering the parasitised tissue of the host (e.g. Exobasidium spp. causing a galling of Azalea, Rhododendron and others of the Ericaceae).\nOf the hymenomycetes, several of Thelephoraceae (e.g. the wood-saprophytic Corticium and Peniophora) have fruiting-bodies with more or less smooth hymenia which resemble patches of paint, but stalked (stipitate) and capped (pileate) toadstool-like and bracket-like structures are developed in others of the family (e.g. Stereum). Corticum solani (Pellicularia lamentosa) is pathogenic to a number of economic crops and is an agent of 'damping-off' — it has an imperfect state referred to Rhizoctonia solani. Other Corticium (e.g. fusi, vagum) are responsible for diseased patches of pastures. Stereum purpureum is an agent of wood-rot especially of fruit trees where causing 'Silver-leaf disease.\nCoral fungi. In the Clavariacee (e.g. the soil-dwelling saprophytic Clavaria) the fruiting-body is a fleshy club-shaped structure which may branch to a coral-like or cauliflower-like mass. While the hymenium of the previous hymenomycetes is smooth, wrinkled, or more or less roughened, that of the Hydnaceae has downward-pointing, spine-, wart-, or granule-like projections. Here, the fruiting-bodies may resemble a crust, bracket, toadstool, coral or (e.g. Odontia) may form a thin patch. Saprophytes of wood or soil, sometimes edible when fleshy (e.g. Hydnum).\nPolypores. Again with great diversity in shape of fruiting-bodies the major family of hymenomycetes, Polyporacee, is differentiated by the character of the hymenium which lines the inner surface of pores or tubes. In Merulius (usually assigned to a family Meruliaceae) it is wax-like or somewhat gelatinous, spread over veins or ridges which form a network of shallow pores. M. lacrymans, the agent of 'dry rot' is a well-known destroyer of timber. In the wood-saprophytic bracket-fungi Daedalia and Lentzites, tubes are formed which divide off plate-like structures which approach the lamella (gill) condition of the family, Agaricaceae, following.\nAs agents of heartwood rot, the polypores are of great concern to forestry. Fomes and some Polyporus are bracket fungi sometimes forming large woody or corky hoof or plate-like masses on tree-trunks from mycelium deep within the host (e.g. the White Punk of Polyporus eucalyptorum recorded with a lateral spread of 45 cm. (18 in.). Other Polyporus produce fleshy fruiting-bodies of the toadstool type. A sometimes large sclerotium, hard and horny when dried, are often formed, e.g. 'Blackfellow's Bread', so-called from a questionable source, of P. myllitae which may reach 60 cm. (24 in.) and weigh 25 or so lbs. and the false sclerotium (compacted from mycelia and sand) of the Stone-making fungus of the mallee, P. basilapioides.\nBoletes. A fleshy toadstool is formed by Boletus (Fam.: Boletaceae) where the hymenium is readily separable from the supporting pileus. The occurrence of highly poisonous members makes the safe eating of Australian species uncertain. Some, e.g. B. luteus found always under or near pines apparently form mycorrhizal associations. Other genera of the family are Gyroporus, Tylopilus).\nAgarics. When the hymenium is inseparable from a fleshy or cartilaginous pileus and is spread over plate-like lamellae (gills), the fungus may be assigned to the Agaricacee. Often the fruiting-body when young is covered by a tissue (a universal veil) which is broken away by growth of the pileus but retained at the base of the supporting stipe as a volva. The hymenium also may be covered at first by a partial veil which later forms a ring or annulus around the stipe. Russula and Lactorius (sometimes assigned to a separate family) differ in the enclosure of spherical cells (sphaerocysts) within a brittle pileus which bears a latex.\nThe agarics (known by the questionably significant names mushrooms and toadstools) mostly are soil-dwelling saprophytes some forming mycorrhizal associations with forest trees. The Honey or Shoe-string Fungus Armillaria mellea, which develops root-strangling cord-like rhizomorphs with the ability to spread considerable distances, is very significant to the forester and orchardist as an agent of root-rot. Its stipe bears a definite ring. Marasmus oreades does considerable damage to pastures and is noted by the peculiar 'fairy-ring' positioning of its fruiting-bodies.\nAmanita is infamous from highly toxic principles contained by some of its species, especially the Angel-of-Death A. phalloides (absent from Australia) and the Fly Agaric A. muscaria (present) rapidly acting but of much lower toxicity. A hallucinogenic principle has been isolated from the Fly Agaric and other hallucinogens from other agarics, e.g. of Psilocybe spp. Amanita may be recognised by the possession of both volva and ring.\nThe true mushrooms may be referred to Psalliota, e.g. the cultivated P. campestris, a widely-distributed field mushroom, and P. arvensis the coarser Horse Mushroom. Also of interest is the bioluminescent Pleurotus lampas frequently found at the base of eucalypts throughout the Commonwealth.\nPuff-Balls, Stink-Horns, Earth Stars. The gasteromycetes also are saprophytes mainly of soil. The fruiting-body typically has an outer wall (peridium) which opens by rupturing or decay for the release of spores, the inner fertile part is the gleba (plural glebae).\nThe nature of the gleba provides a basis for the orders. In the order of stink-horns, Phallales, the gleba is gelatinous and is carried upwards on a stalked receptacle on break-down of the peridium. The name 'stink-horn' refers to the typical horn-like receptacle and the foetid odour from the gleba when exposed and disintegrating for the release of spores.\nAustralian representatives include Mutinus and Phallus. In others of the order, e.g. Clathrus, the receptacle is in the form of a lattice-work basket, in Lysurus it is a hollow cylinder from which arise distinct erect arms which bear the glebae, and in Aseroe the arms spread horizontally. The receptacle is often of a bright red colour and bears at its base a volva representing the ruptured peridium.\nWith greater occurrence in Australia is the order Hymenogastrales seen above ground only as a mature fruiting-body which is small, more or less globular (e.g. Hymenogaster, Hysterangium, Rhizopogon) or stalked and of various shape (e.g. Secotium). The gleba usually is fleshy or waxy and composed of a network of numerous plate-like structures, often borne by a simple or branched stem or columella.\nThe puff-balls and some earth-stars are included by Lycoperdales. The gleba here is powdery and, when mature, is dissolved (autodigested) to leave a mass of spores dispersible ('puffable') by air currents or physical contact. Most of the puff-balls occur in Lycoperdon. The fruiting-body may be small but may also be large (e.g. Calvatia gigantea recorded in Australia up to 40 cm. (16 in.): it may be sessile or stemmed and of various shape. The earth stars, e.g. Geastrum, owe their shape to the involucre formed by the ruptured peridium around the globular stemmed or sessile 'puff-ball'.\nTwo other puff-ball genera, Scleroderma and Pisolithus are included by the Sclerodermatales typified by a peridium thick and hard, and a hymenium of poor organisation. In the final order Nidulariales, a cup-like fruiting-body is hollow when mature, lined inside by a number of lens-shaped structures, peridioles, within which are the basidiospores, e.g. the Bird's Nest Fungi of Crucibulum and Cyathus. Also occurring in Australia and of the same order is Sphaerobolus with a minute, spherical fruiting-body containing a single peridiole, which is dehisced with force by an elastic mechanism of the ruptured peridium."

In addition to parasitism, agencies may be nutritional or hormonal disturbances. When parasitism is the agency, (e.g. the feeding of the larvae of coccids), it is conceivable that a secretion from the insect either causes an over-stimulation of growth substance controlling the development of tissue, or the secretion itself acts as a growth stimulant. In such cases, the gall becomes an integral part of the insect's life history. Other galling may concern the conversion of structural parts, e.g. stamens and carpels to petal-like parts.\nA feature of the organoid type of gall is a frequent high content of tannin, e.g. the 'nutgalls' of oak Quercus spp. with from 50 to 70 percent tannins and 2 to 4 percent gallic acid are items of commerce."

The substantive (in singular number) applies particularly to a subgenus or section, e.g. Hymenophyllum subgenus Craspedophyllum, the plural adjective to a subsection or lower rank, e.g. Eucalyptus series Siderophloia."

        "term": "Geological Time",
        "meaning": "the time covering the development of the planet Earth to the present. Through the combined techniques of the physical sciences, a reasonable estimate is possible of the minimum age - this estimate is in the order of 4,500 million years. The first fossils represent a pre-600 million year age (i.e. are from the Pre-Cambrian Era) and are of organisms of fairly complex nature - blue green algae, aquatic fungi, and primitive animals of the sponges and coelenterates.\nAgain from the aspect of life's evolution, it is convenient to divide the post-600 million years to units of a time-scale. The primary units of the accepted time-scale are eras, each era representing an evolutionary stage in the life of animals (hence the suffix -zoic). On the basis of the stratification of fossil-yielding rocks, eras are divided to periods, the name derived from either the locality or a feature associated with the locality where first recognised. For convenience, the periods may be divided to Early, Middle, Late or to the corresponding Lower, Middle, Upper sub-units. For finer time-spans, periods may be divided to epochs, and epochs to stages. The immensity of the time factor may be demonstrated by the compression of the earth's history to a single year, its origin being January 1st. Within this 'year', the history of man would be recorded for the final forty seconds before midnight, December 31st. (Rhodes, 1962).\nWith the emphasis on the development of Australia's land flora, where known, the following events are given very briefly for the periods of time, together with the age and duration in millions of years. Such events largely are the interpretations from fossil pollen and plant parts (vegetative and reproductive) fossilised or petrified. There are large gaps in the palaeobotany of Australia, however.\n\nCambrian (600; 110). Climate in general warm and uniform. Fossils abundant of marine invertebrates (e.g. the arthropod trilobite) and algae. Fossiliferous limestones at great depth (the coral reefs of Archaeocyathinae fossils) indicate an east-west isolation by an inland sea through the continent.\nOrdovician to Devonian (490 to 400: 140). Climate semi-arid in later stages but with heavy seasonal rain. First records of terrestrial plants (e.g. psilopsids), some with tree habit (lepidodendrids) forming forests, fish, and land animals.\nCarboniferous (350: 80). Development of the seed-ferns (pteridosperms) and forests of lycopsids and ferns widespread in marshes. Early in the period large araucarian-like cordaites (Cordaitales) followed by the earliest-known conifers with features resembling those of Araucaria excelsa.\nPermian (270: 50). Climate from temperate/sub-tropical to arid but with recurrent glaciation. Disappearance of most of the tree-like lycopsids and ferns (except tree-ferns), psilopsids and lepidodendrids. Appearance of the Ginkgoales in Asia. In Australia conditions favourable for the formation of coal.\nTriassic and Jurassic (220 to 180: 85). Development of conifers, and, although true origin unknown, the cycadioids, the ancestors of cycads. Some evidence from the Middle Triassic of the first angiosperms but it is possible their true origin is in the former era (the Palaeozoic). Rise of the mammoth reptiles, earliest records of birds and pterodactyls, and mammals in the Jurassic. In Australia, vast fresh-water lakes in the east. Up until close of period, land migration between Asia and the continent appears possible.\nCretaceous (135: 77). Climate at first warm temperate, becoming colder and ending in a glacial period which decimated the reptiles but did not diminish the dominance of the angiosperms. Rise of the primitive mammals. Much of Central Australia inundated by marine invasions which divided the continent to two or three islands.\nTertiary Era (58 to 12: 57). Mildly warm during greater part, humid early but oscillating between sub-tropical and arid at close. Peneplanation of Australia during greater part but, at close, epeirogenetic earth movements effecting uplift in south-east (Dividing Range, Mount Lofty-Flinders Range) and formation of Gulf region of South Australia. Large deposits of limestones by inundation from the Great Bight. By fall in sea-level, New Guinea (part of the continental shelf) in land contact with the continent. Change in vegetation from the cycad and conifer/Nothofagus forests to grasslands of the inland plains. From evidence of the Cinnamomum Flora, a pan continental mesic flora is indicated in addition to a sclerophyllous one (e.g. fossils referred to Eucalyptus and Acacia. Mammals now prominent.\nQuartenary Era (1: 1). Pleistocene: marked oscillations in temperature and rainfall but evidence suggests that the great desert of Australia, originating probably from the Tertiary, was always present. Ice sheets formed during the severe glacial periods now restricted to the Australian Alps and the western half of Tasmania. Minor vulcanism in the south-east and east, elsewhere continual erosion and silting. No mountains formed. Sea-level changes on at least two occasions connect again New Guinea with the mainland.\nRecent: marked by widespread aridity, apparently quite abruptly. Elimination of the giant marsupials and much of the flora. Retraction of the surviving flora to more favourable locations. Again the isolation of the east from the west of the mainland but this time by desert. Eventual stabilisation and expansion of flora to the evidence of today."

        "meaning": "the union of living parts from different origins to form a structure physiologically acting as a single unit. Of woody plants, a shoot (scion) or bud propagated by its union (grafting) with a larger rooted plant (stock) through the reorganisation of meristematic tissues of the calluses formed on the severed parts, the cambium, phloem and xylem forming a continuous unit. Usually the stock and scion are of the same, or of closely related species, the stock appearing to have no permanent genetic effect on the scion although influencing its physiology.\nNatural grafting may occur when two individually-rooted plants grow in such close proximity that a point of contact is reached where union of meristems is possible. e.g. in natural root-grafting where a pressure point arises from regions of individual roots in close contact, mutual translocation being evidenced by the continued growth in diameter of the stump of a felled graft-member.\n\nSeed-graft: the union of a scion which substitutes within a germinated seed for the removed original shoot, a method used in the maintenance of clones, e.g. of macadamia.\nGraft-hybrid: the individual formed by a grafting where an association of meristems creates a tissue complex of genetically distinct cells (i.e. a chimaera), the appearance of the individual resembling that of both stock and scion."

Formed either as a response to gummosis (e.g. acacia gums) or as a metabolic product (e.g. tragacanth). Chemically closely allied is a mucilage, differing in that it occurs naturally as a mucus or slime especially of seed, but often refers simply to an aqueous solution of a gum.\nThe gum of commerce may be used in certain industrial and pharmaceutical processes, e.g. as an adhesive, as a stabiliser (e.g. of ice-cream mixes), an emulsifying agent or other agent used in the paper-making, cosmetic and food fields. It is chiefly an exudate from Cyamopsis tetragonoloba (Guar Gum), Astragalus gummifer (Gum tragacanth) both of the Papilionaceae, or various Acacia species (Gum arabic). A number of Australian acacias have been considered for their potential (as so-called wattle gums), viz. Acacia pycnantha, A. decurrens, A. mearnsii, A. dealbata, A. sentis, A. homalophylla, but costs in processing have impeded an industrial development.

        "id": 15560,
        "term": "Gymnosperm",
        "meaning": "a seed-bearing vascular plant characterised by the non-enclosure of its ovule (and seed) by a structure resembling the ovary formed by carpels of the angiosperm, but exposed except for one or two integuments on the surface of a sporophyll. Frequently, the sporophyll in series with others to form a cone-like structure (strobilus or cone) either a pollen producing cone or an ovule-bearing cone developed by the one individual (the plant monoecious) or different individuals (the species dioecious). Contrasting again with the angiosperm, the female gametophyte is multicellular (500 or more cells), stores the main food reserves for the seed and, with a few exceptions, produces from two to many archegonia from each of which arises a single egg cell. Its male gametophyte is marked by the development of a conspicuous pollen-tube when the male gametes are non-motile, and often from one to many prothallial cells.\n\nClassification: It is agreed generally that the extant gymnosperm is a member of one of four distinct groups, and in the fossil state is included by the fossil-orders Cordaitales, Cycadofilicales, and Bennettiales. There is no agreement as to the levels of these groups, some authors treating them as classes, others as divisions. Cronquist (1960) recognises two groups at divisional level, the Cycadophyta and the Coniferophyta.\nThe division Cycadophyta is characterised by pinnately-compound fern-like leaves, rare branching of stems, little or no secondary growth, and male gametes (sperm) flagellate and motile. It has a single class Cycadae. The Coniferophyta have simple, usually small leaves, branching stems and well-developed secondary growth, and non-motile male gametes (except in Ginkgo). The classes recognised are Coniferae and Chlamydospermae.\nFeatures of Coniferae include simple male cones, simple, compound, or undeveloped female cones, ovules with a single integument, embryos usually with more than two cotyledons, absence of vessels within the wood but with frequent presence of resin-canals.\nThe Chlamydospermae feature compound cones for both male and female (most species dioecious), ovules with two integuments with at least the inner forming a conspicuous micropylar tube, embryo with two cotyledons, secondary wood with vessels but without resin-canals. Three genera are included, Ephedra, Gnetum, Welwitschia, each considered to constitute a distinct order and family but sometimes treated under a single order Gnetales. There are no archegonia formed by the female gametophyte of Gnetum and Welwitschia, in the former a nucleus with some cytoplasm functions as an egg-cell, and in Welwitschia a single cell acts directly as an egg. Ephedra, with several scale-leaved species, occurs throughout the Mediterranean region, Asia and the Americas. Gnetum, with several broad-leaved, pinnately veined species, is restricted to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and South America. Welwitschia has a single species (W. mirabilis) with long, strap-like leaves (strictly thong like segments split from two initial and persistent leaves) confined to deserts of south-west Africa.

In structure, typically composed of a single flattened blade (lamina) of varying form and division, and a stalk-like petiole which joins the stem at a point, the leaf-base, sometimes distinctive as a pulvinus. The origin of a leaf is from a crescent-shaped leaf-buttress derived from and lateral to the apical meristem of the shoot. Its meristem may remain diffuse, the lamina then of simple shape, become localised to differentiate the lamina to various degrees of lobing or division, or be intercalary (q.v.). The internal connection with the stem is through a vascular system which extends as a venation throughout its lamina. In addition to its role in photosynthesis, the leaf is the organ for transpiration, shows a higher level of respiratory activity than do other parts, and provides an accessory system of exchange with the atmosphere of solutes concerned in the control of salt and moisture relationships within the plant.

        "id": 19770,
        "term": "Lichen",
        "meaning": "a dual organism (consortium) formed by the symbiotic association of one or more fungi (usually an ascomycete) with one or more unicellular green (e.g. Trehouxia) or blue green (e.g. Nostoc) algae.\nAn important primary coloniser of bare areas (e.g. rock faces) of polar to tropical regions, the thallus formed often foliaceous, erect and branched (fruticose), or like a dry crust (crustose). While fragmentation is more usual, reproduction may be sexual through the means normal to the species of the individuals when the spore of the fungus will germinate only when in contact with an alga similar to the symbiotic partner of the parent. A type of asexual reproduction may proceed by a soredium, a structure formed by the clustering of algal cells and fungal hyphae which forms a new consortium when separated from the parent.\nThe problem of naming the approx. 17,000 species of dual organisms is met by giving precedence to the fungal component, the fungus not known to occur in the habitat of the lichen free from symbiosis. The lichen is attributed with extremely slow growth and longevity of high degree, e.g. certain polar species are accredited with an age of some 4,500 years.\nThe lichen is usually high in polysaccharide (e.g. lichenin) content, it may secrete an essential oil, or be pigmented. The resin Oakmoss extracted from the European Evernia prumastri and E. furfuracea yields an essential oil used as a commercial perfumery oil, especially for soaps. The pigment may be of value as a dye as, e.g. the blue and red dyes of the family Rocellaceae which, before substitution by coal tar derivatives (e.g. amaranth) provided the dye of 'litmus paper'. Certain extractives have found value as antibiotics, e.g. usnic acid, a common component with relatively high yield, used in the treatment of certain skin diseases."

        "id": 19790,
        "term": "Light",
        "meaning": "that form of electromagnetic radiation or flow of radiant energy usually interpreted (in botany) as visible light, i.e. the spectrum receptive to the retina of the eye and translatable through the optical system as visual sensation. Exhibits the nature of a transverse wave (e.g. diffraction) and also a photoelectric effect (e.g. its excitation of a photosensitive substance such as selenium which creates from this receptor a flow of electrons which may be registered as an electric current when directed along a suitable conducting wire). May be considered hence as a transverse wave of particles (photons) with a flow of 186,000 miles per second, each photon a unit of energy or light quantum with energy directly proportional to its frequency.\nThe major source of light is the nuclear fission from the sun in the conversion of the nuclei of its hydrogen atoms to helium atoms and electrons, the waves of energy principally are in the form of gamma or X-rays of very high energy, ultra-violet radiation, visible light, infra-red, and radio waves of low energy, these making up the solar spectrum. In terms of wavelengths (the distance between two crests of successive waves) the shortest waves reaching the earth through the atmospheric screen are in the ultra-violet region at about 2900 Angstroms; the visible spectrum is in the region 4,000 to 7,000 A., and above this is the infra-red region. Ultra-violet radiation (experienced as sunburn, snowburn and eyeburn) is of less importance to major plant life, much being screened off by the atmosphere while the epidermis of the plant provides an effective barrier. For unicellular or micro-organisms (e.g. bacteria and fungi) its effect is much more drastic in doses either lethal to them or inducing harmful metabolic and genetic changes. The infra-red radiation is known by its heating effect of the earth, essential to the maintenance of life; visible light provides, through photosynthesis, the energy essential to living organisms.\nQuality of light. The compound nature of the 'white' light of the visible spectrum may be demonstrated from its passage through a glass prism when, by reflection and refraction, its component wave-lengths are dispersed. By visual sensation, the dispersed rays may be registered as a band of colour. A similar effect is obtained when a fine mist of water acts as the dispersing and reflecting medium, an arc (or rainbow) of colours (red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet) is perceptive to the eye. The relative proportions of wave-lengths available to the object of reference give the quality of light.\nThe colour of white light reflected by a substance is determined by the absorption of certain wave-lengths (i.e. the absorption spectrum for that substance). When the reflected light appears white, there is no absorption, when e.g. red, all wave lengths other than that corresponding with the red band are absorbed, the red only refiected, and when appearing black there is no reflection. Chlorophyll absorbs in the violet and red bands to greatest degree, least in the green; the orange-yellow carotenoids absorb from the blue and violet regions. While the yellow to red region of the visible spectrum is most effective in photosynthesis, under certain conditions the green region may be effective also. For all conditions, the correlation of photosynthesis with the absorption spectrum of photosynthetic pigments is not direct.\nIntensity of light. Factors other than the quality of light appear of greater significance to the growth of plants, viz. intensity and duration. Intensity is the amount of light received at a specific distance from the light-source (see foot-candle, lumen, lux, phot). For terrestrial plants it is determined initially by the distance of the sun and the angle of its rays to the earth's surface, and by the amount of cloud cover (or fog or smog) in the atmosphere, these being influenced by latitude and season. In general, the influence of high intensity is a promotion (in association with such factors as phytohormones) of flowering and fruiting, and an inhibition of vegetative growth. See also photoperiod, incident, transmitted, phytochrome."

        "term": "Light microscope",
        "meaning": "an instrument designed to enlarge the image of an object by transmission of light reflected from the object through an optical system of lens (or a single lens when simple). It is in contrast with the electron microscope by the latter's functioning through a flow of electrons directed by a system of electromagnets. Since the wave-length of the electron flow is considerably shorter than that of visible or ultra-violet light (e.g. 0.05 Angstroms for a 60,000 volt electron flow), far greater magnification and resolution of detail are possible, although far greater elaboration in equipment and preparation are required. The limit of the light microscope is 2,000 diameters (or about 3,000 for ultra-violet light: magnifications of 100,000 diameters by the electron microscope are familiar. The theoretic resolution of 1 Angstrom for the electron microscope, optimum at 100 kV. to 1,000 kV. electron flow, is offset by certain inherent factors consequent of the high voltages required, e.g. vibration of object, thermal drift, additional to problems associated with preparation of the object."

        "meaning": "a pteridophyte (q.v.) differentiated to a definite stem, true leaves and roots, the leaf basically in spiral arrangement and with venation a single, unbranched vein which arises from a single leaf-trace unbroken by a leaf-gap from the vascular system (protostele or siphonostele) of the stem (i.e. the leaf a microphyll). Branching of the unsegmented stem is dichotomous, monopodial or sympodial. Sporangia are eusporangiate (i.e. formed from a superficial group of cells), axillary to unmodified or relatively modified leaves, or on the adaxial surface near the base of the leaf, usually the sporophylls collected in a terminal strobilus.\nA member of a class Lycopodiae or division Lepidophyta of some authors, dating back to the Palaeozoic when sometimes reaching large tree size. Extant members are placed in three orders, Lycopodiales of two genera, Selaginellales and Isoetales both monogeneric, the first two usually referred to as the club-moss orders, the Isoetales the quillwort order.\nLycopodiales, of a single family with two herbaceous genera (a third, Huperzia, is sometimes recognised), are distinguished by homospory, a pro-thallus (usually associated with a fungus) free-living (exosporic), an absence of a ligule to the leaf, the non-aggregation in some members of the sporophylls in definite strobili, and the development of roots adventitious from a rhizome. Lycopodium has about 450 species world-wide, chiefly tropical, in distribution, 8 in Australia (e.g. Mountain Moss, L. deuterodensum, L. cernuum). Overseas, the spores of several species have been used as 'lycopodium powder' for the manufacture of fireworks and as a dusting powder. Pigmy club-moss Phylloglossum drummondii is confined to temperate Australia and New Zealand. It is up to or less than 5 cm. (2 in.) in height, has 1-8 linear leaves and a solitary strobilus borne on a leafless peduncle.\nSelaginellales feature heterospory, the microsporangia and megasporangia more commonly together within the same strobilus, a prothallus never entirely free from the wall of the spore (i.e. endosporic), a constant arrangement of sporophylls in strobili, a tongue-like appendage (ligule) on the adaxial surface of the leaf and the development of adventitious roots from prop-like structures (rhizophores) at the points of branching of the stem. Selaginella has about 700 herbaceous species throughout the temperate parts of the world, 9 in Australia, e.g. S. uliginosa, S. preissiana.\nThe quillworts of Isoetes, the single genus of Isoetales, are heterosporous and endosporic, the vegetative structure a corm-like stem with a tuft of linear or awl-shaped, ligulate leaves with broad sheathing bases arising from the upper surface and with a basal rhizophore from which roots are produced in regular series. Exceptional to the class are a vascular cambium and multi-flagellate male gametes (sperm). The 75 species are distributed throughout the temperate parts of the world but poorly represented in Australia, Plain Quillwort I. drummondii up to 10 cm. (4 in.) in height scattered throughout the temperate states, and Rock Quillwort I. humilior widespread throughout the temperate states."

        "meaning": "of a eucalypt when shrub-like in growth, the habit often associated with harsh conditions of soil and rainfall when a characteristic mallee scrub may be formed. Used also as the noun.\nStrictly true mallees are those naturally confined to arid or adverse habitats when the ability to regenerate freely from the lignotuber is an adaptive feature. Most eucalypts develop lignotubers and the few which do not (e.g. Alpine and Mountain Ash, Karri, River Red Gum) do produce a small swelling above their root-system, not fire-resistant, but with a capacity for suckering. The potential to maintain themselves (as mallees) is a feature of most eucalypts when subjected to harsh conditions, the reverse holds that many true mallees, when grown under more moderate conditions, are capable of developing the tree habit.\nIn Western Australia, a marlock is recognised. The marlock is noted for its mallee-like form but poor development of a ligno-tuber. The distinction is not always clear so that the term mallee in common usage usually is inclusive of the marlock. The Mallets and Moorts, also of the west, again may be included, the Mallets are small trees with a bushy crown, sometimes forming thickets, some (e.g. Eucalyptus astringens) are commercially-important sources of tan-bark. Moorts (e.g. E. platypus, E. nutans) are marlocks with smooth grey bark, below thirty feet in height. In the east and south-east are recognised Whipstick Mallees when small and with slender, whiplike stems (e.g. E. gracilis), and Bull Mallees (e.g. E. oleosa, E. behriana) when of larger proportions - the two forms are influenced largely by site, particularly when forming scrub, so that the same species may assume either habit according to the habitat. The two small botanic groups, united largely by features of the anther, Mallee Gums (e.g. E. foecunda) and Mallee Boxes (e.g. E. fruticetorum, E. viridis are somewhat confusing since Blue Mallee E. fruticetorum noted as a source of a valuable essential oil although of highly limited natural occurrence, has a decorticating bark quite unlike the persistent bark typifying boxes. Such mallees again may occur as whipstick or bull types."

As a result of crossing-over (q.v.) possible among segments of paired chromosomes, a recombination of genes (alleles) effects a qualitative difference in the genetic constitutions of the four nuclei.\nFor those plants with a regular heteromorphic alternation of generations, meiosis marks the beginning of the haploid (gametophytic) phase (or haplophase) of the life-cycle, the tetrad of spores formed meiotically from a spore mother-cell being the first cells of the haploid generation. Since further nuclear divisions are without reduction (i.e. are mitotic), the haploid condition is maintained up to fusion of nuclei contributed by gametes at fertilisation. The resultant zygote of this fusion is the first cell of the restored diploid condition, hence the beginning of the spore-producing generation (sporophyte or diplophase)."

        "term": "Mutation",
        "meaning": "a change within a genetic system (either by a gene or chromosome) which produces in the mutant (or variant) a slight or profound effect. The effect may be of benefit, the mutation continued as a hereditary variation.\nMutation of a gene may occur from some chemical change, the substituted gene being reduplicated, and, of chromosomes, the change may occur by multiplication of the set (polyploidy), by addition or loss within the set (aneuploidy), by structural reconstitution (see inversion, translocation), by chemical alteration, or by breakdown of the duplicating process during cell-division. Both reproductive and vegetative (somatic) cells may be the origin of the mutation: when a somatic mutation, the effect is localised as in bud-sports, chimaeras, variegation, fasciation etc.\nIn nature, mutation usually is at random but, by various artifcial means (e.g. irradiations, reactive chemical substances), may be induced under controlled conditions."

        "term": "Nomenclature",
        "meaning": "the naming of groups of organisms (taxa) in conformity with an international code designed for precision and universal comprehension. When the taxon is a species, its naming conforms to a binomial, a qualifying name (specific epithet) added to a generic name. When a sub-species or variety, a further qualifying name forms a trinomial. For uniformity, when a subspecies or variety is formed, the residue of the parent species also becomes a sub-species or variety and takes again the name of the species, e.g. Leptospermum lanigerum var. macrocarpum, L. lanigerum var. lanigerum. While Latin is the basic language used, a derivation from the Greek (latinised Greek) also is in use and, with an appropriate latinised ending, an infinite variety of other languages may be used, e.g. wooroonooran, jibberdingensis, Geleznowia, Scheuchzeriaceae etc.\nFor a family or taxon of lower rank, the code accepts one name only and this must be the earliest name conforming to the rules of priority, i.e. the earliest legitimate (validly published) name at the same level. A validly published name implies the provision of a published description and nomination of a specimen as the nomenclatural 'type' or, in certain cases, a specimen or figure of a specimen bearing the name without doubt as to its identity. The rules of priority are retrospect to a definite publishing date, in the case of vascular plants and, with a few exceptions, algae, 1st May, 1753 (Linnaeus, Species plantarum ed. 1.). For certain genera and levels up to family where long usage favours a retention, a name (nomina conservanda) not the earliest may be approved. From the beginning of 1935, a name is accepted as validly published only when a diagnosis (in Latin) is included.\nFor hybrids between two species or two genera, designation may be made by either a formula or (if desirable) a name. The formula takes the form of a citation of the names of both parents separated by an X (e.g. Eucalyptus camfieldii X haemastoma); the name is formed by qualification with an X before the 'specific epithet' (e.g. Eucalyptus X pygmaea) in the case of a cross between species, or before the 'generic name in the case of a bigeneric cross (e.g. X Solidago).

        "id": 23190,
        "term": "Nucleic acid",
        "meaning": "a highly complex polymer occurring (as a nucleo-protein) in both nucleus and cytoplasm, composed essentially of unbranched chains of nucleotides (about ten thousand nucleotides to each chain), hence chemically a polynucleotide. The nucleotide consists of a pentose sugar (ribose or deoxyribose) to which is attached a phosphate group (linked with the sugar and by repetition forming the polynucleotide) and a nitrogenous side group, pyrimidine base (cytosine, thymine, uracil) or a purine base (adenine, guanine).\nWhen the sugar is desoxyribose (which has one of the -OH groups of ribose substituted by an -H group), the nucleic acid is known as deoxyribose nucleic acid (or sometimes desoxyribose nucleic acid), DNA. The model by Watson and Crick (1953) of the structure of DNA is a two-strand helix, i.e. two helical chains coiled around the same axis, each chain carrying at random along its length four different nucleotides. Each chain is connected to the other by a special type of bonding (hydrogen bond) of pairs of bases, either adenine or thymine together, or guanine and cytosine together. This selective grouping of bases ensures that the sequence of bases on one chain determines the sequence on the other, thus, when uncoiling and separation of a helix occurs (as at nuclear division) a new chain built on one of the original chains has the same sequence of bases. Since DNA is confined almost exclusively to chromosomes, the view is acceptable that it is the coding system created by the positioning of the nucleotides which provides a template upon which synthesis, e.g., of protein, is based. DNA is considered both the carrier of genetic information and the template for synthesis of RNA.\nRNA differs from DNA in its ribose sugar (hence ribose nucleic acid) and substitution of thymine by uracil. It occurs both in nucleus and cytoplasm, and is of at least three forms. According to function, it is named messenger RNA (mRNA), transfer RNA (tRNA), and ribosomal RNA (rRNA). In the synthesis of a protein, the function of these appears to concern (1) the 'acceptance' by mRNA of information from DNA in determining the course from the 64 possible combinations supplied by a 'triplet' of three adjacent nucleotides required for synthesis of a single amino acid (2) transfer by tRNA of the amino acid to a site, the ribosome, found in both nucleus and cytoplasm and where the concentration of RNA is greatest (3) direction of protein synthesis, i.e. the coding by rRNA of the amino acids to form a specific protein."

Its reproductive cells are located in a nucellus, the tip of the nucellus is exposed by a micropyle but a major part is enclosed by one or two integuments which merge at the base to a chalaza. The ovule of an angiosperm is formed from, and retained by, the ovary of a carpel, attached to the wall of the ovary either directly or supported by a funicle. Of conifers, the ovule is developed on the upper surtace of a scale (ovuliferous scale), the nucellus, and enclosed by a single integument.\nWithin reproductive cells (archesporium) of the ovule, megaspore mother cells by meiotic divisions form megaspores in tetrads, only one of which survives to become the mother cell for the embryo-sac of angiosperms, but in gymnosperms the gametophyte is represented by a definite archegonium (usually two or more being formed) similar to that of the pteridophyte and containing the egg-cell, and a multicellular prothallus concerned with food-storage for the ultimate embryo. The embryo-sac possibly represents two archegonia without prothallial cells, within it are developed eight nuclei, three of which are persistent, one the egg-cell, the others polar nuclei. At fertilisation, the egg-cell fuses with a male nucleus to form a zygote, the polar nuclei fuse with a second male nucleus to originate an endosperm.\nSee also placentation."

The substance losing (or donating) electrons (being oxidised) is the reducing agent since it is responsible for the reduction (gain in electrons) of another substance. Conversely, the substance gaining (accepting) electrons (being reduced) is the oxidising agent. The terms oxidant and reductant are also in use, the oxidant being the reducing agent, the reductant the oxidising agent.\nThe principle may be illustrated by the overall mechanism of photosynthesis which, in its simplest sense, may be regarded as a reduction-oxidation system (redox system) where carbon dioxide is reduced by the acceptance of hydrogen ions from a hydrogen carrier (e.g. water) to form a carbohydrate of the form CH₂O: If water is the hydrogen carrier, it is oxidised to molecular or free oxygen by loss of hydrogen ions.\nCO₂ + 2H₂O, with energy of light → (CH₂O) + O₂ + H₂O.\nIn respiration, a simple sugar forms carbon dioxide and water by loss of hydrogen ions, the bound energy from photosynthesis being released for redistribution.\nC₆H₁₂0₆ + 6O₂ → 6C0₂ + O₂ + H20 + energy."

When the methoxyl (i.e. a CH₂O group) is absent or virtually so, the substance is a pectic acid: both pectinic and pectic acids are water-soluble and salt-forming.\nWhen a pectinic acid forms a gel with sugar and acid, it is termed a pectin, commercially extracted from fruit and vegetable wastes. A pectin has wide use as a gelling agent in the preparation of jellies, jams, preserves, and as a stabiliser for ice-cream and various confections. In fruit juices extracted from fresh fruits, the colloids formed by pectic substances produce an often undesired turbidity. Use is made of pectolytic enzymes (commercially obtained from filtrates of such fungi as Aspergillus and Penicillium spp.) to break down the pectic substances and their colloids to produce a flocculent precipitate which may be filtered off to leave a clear solution."

Its potential usually is expressed in k cal (see calorie) per mole, indicating the amount of biochemical work obtainable from the bond. Thus the high energy bond of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) (12 k cal) can be compared with the low energy bond of glucose-6-phosphate (2 k cal.).\nThe energy of metabolic processes, originally derived from the radiant energy of sunlight (see photosynthesis) is liberated at the oxidation of synthesised compounds (i.e. respiration) and is stored in phosphates with high energy bonds (indicated by -P). Chief of these is ATP in which three phosphate groups are linked with the sugar ribose in combination with a derivative of the organic base adenine. When hydrolysed, a phosphate group is split off from ATP to form adenosine diphosphate (ADP) with the freeing of about 7 k cal. energy available for biochemical work."

        "meaning": "biosynthesis through photochemical means. A process directly or indirectly fundamental to the nutritional maintenance of all living organisms but limited to those with the essential means for absorbing and converting radiant energy to chemical energy.\nThe chlorophylls contained by chloroplasts and chromatophores provide the immediate means while secondary are the accessory carotenoid and phycobilin pigments which absorb light of different wave-length. Except for bacterial photosynthesis, the raw materials are carbon dioxide and water, products released to the atmosphere from respiration of organisms. Oxygen is a side-product of photosynthesis by green plants, hence the re-cycling of these gases, maintains a relative constant of carbon dioxide and oxygen in the atmosphere.\nThe process operates under conditions of from low light intensity (as by seaweeds at the lower depths of the photic region where the intensity is about equal to moonlight) to high intensity (as by terrestrial plants of the arid desert in full sunlight), but of the total available light, a very small traction (estimated at about one-thousandth part) is used hence in terms of the available potential for energy conversion, a relatively inefficient process. The world output of organic matter from the process is believed at about 14 x 10¹⁰ tons per year, a large proportion of this contributed by the pelagic plankton.\nThe primary end-product of photosynthesis when carbon dioxide and water are the raw materials is the carbohydrate glucose, its synthesis involving the 'splitting' of water to hydrogen ions (for the ultimate reduction of carbon dioxide) and hydroxyl ions (for the eventual evolution of free, or molecular, oxygen). The chemical reactions are numerous and complex, each requiring a specific group of enzymes. Much of the biochemical detail has been elucidated at least for the plant where isotopic and other techniques have been applied (viz. such unicellular algae as Chlorella). In general, recent concepts are based on the observations of Robert Hill (1939) and D. Arnon (1954), Hill noting that isolated chloroplasts from minced leaves evolved oxygen when illuminated, in water, with suitable hydrogen acceptors (e.g. ferric ions). Arnon noted that chloroplasts under similar conditions also brought about the phosphorylation of ATP from ADP (see phosphorylation) and phosphate. As early as 1904 Blackman proposed that photosynthesis occurred in two phases, a series of reactions occurring in light (i.e. photochemical) and a subsequent series when light was not involved (i.e. thermochemical, or dark reactions) Quantitative comparative studies, e.g. by a flashing light of high intensity but short duration compared with a non-flashing or continuous light giving greater production of photosynthate, have substantiated this proposal and the light (photochemical) reactions have been termed the Hill reaction, the dark (thermochemical) the Blackman reaction.\nThe Hill reaction concerns the 'acceptance', conversion and cycling of light energy to chemical energy, the synthesis of ATP and co-enzyme NADPH and the evolution of free oxygen. ATP and the co-enzyme appear essential for the assimilation of carbon dioxide, their synthesis termed photophosphorylation, cyclic when ATP is the product, non-cyclic when the co-enzyme is formed by the reduction of its nucleotide. The primary reaction and the mechanism dissociating oxygen are yet to be resolved, one concept (photolysis) being that the energy of light directly dissociates water to reducing H⁺ and oxidising OH⁻ ions, another that the excitation of chlorophyll by light effects a flow of energy-carrying electrons which, directed through cytochromes, have a cyclic pathway in the generation of ATP back to chlorophyll, and a replacement from OH⁻ (contributed by the ionisation of water) when oxygen is released and the H⁺ used in the reduction of the nucleotide.\nThe dark or Blackman reaction concerning the reduction of carbon dioxide is even more complex. In general, it follows the pathway - formation of an intermediate of glycolysis (see respiration), phosphoglyceric acid, by the combining of carbon dioxide with a phosphorylated pentose sugar - conversion of this intermediate to a triose sugar phosphate, 3-phosphoglyceraldehyde, through reduction by H⁺ and energy supplied by ATP and the reduced nucleotide - derivation from this phosphate of glucose and other sugars. For the reduction of each molecule of CO₂, 3 molecules of ATP and 2 molecules of NADPH are required.\nIts course was defined in 1961 by M. Calvin hence it is known as the Calvin cycle.\nCompensation point is the point when the rate of biosynthesis equals the rate of break-down of the products by respiration, above this point the gaseous exchange characterising photosynthesis ensues, carbohydrate being formed when the ratio (photosynthetic coefficient) of the volume of oxygen released and the volume of carbon dioxide absorbed is unity. The process is 'saturated' in respect to a factor when an increase effecting a decrease in an inhibiting or depressing factor (dependent on the optimum requirement of the plant) no longer effects an increase in the photosynthetic rate, e.g. a factor of light may be limiting at a low concentration but when brought to optimum level, other factors (e.g. concentration of carbon dioxide) may become limiting, photosynthesis thus being 'saturated' in respect to light.\nSingle, or interacting, factors which may become limiting to the photosynthetic rate include (under conditions appropriate for the plant) - nature, intensity and duration of light, the concentration of carbon dioxide available (0.03 percent normally present in the atmosphere, compared with 0.01 percent at compensation point, an increase may increase the rate assuming photosynthesis is saturated in respect to light, but up to a point when its concentration may become toxic to the plant), the amount of water in the photosynthetic region than theambient air, the process rarely proceeding below -5°C. but increasing up to about 37°C.), the accumulation of photosynthate by non-translocation (an inhibiting effect which may occur when there is a severe reduction in water availability), the percentage of pigment not utilising light but losing energy as heat.

Red light (at 6600 A) is most effective but the response may be reversed if followed immediately by exposure to far-red light at 7300 A), and re-activated by re-exposure to red light. It is believed that phytochrome exists in two interconvertible forms, Pr (or P₆₆₀) and Pfr (or P₇₃₀).

        "meaning": "(Plant Growth Substance): an organic biocatalyst synthesised by the plant with an effect, in relatively low concentration, singly or in interaction with other phytohormones, of accelerating or retarding the processes concerned in growth and development.\nSince F. Went's first proof, in 1928, of the existence and significance of such a substance, much of the biochemical detail concerning structure of the molecule has been derived, leading to the development of a number of synthetic substances with similar effect. Relatively little is known, however, of the actual synthesis and mode of operation within the plant.\nThe role of phytohormones is seen as a regulation involving both promoting and inhibiting influences, e.g. promoting cambial division while inhibiting development of axillary buds. When in higher than optimum concentration (as evidenced by synthetic substances), an inhibiting or toxic effect may be produced. The probability has been demonstrated that the physiology of the plant is influenced by an interaction of growth-promoting substance and other catalyst (e.g. an enzyme or mineral ion), a hormone of a different kind, or an environmental factor (e.g. light). It has been demonstrated, e.g., that the gas ethylene C₂H₄, produced in minute amounts as a metabolite, in conjunction with oxygen is concerned in the processes leading to the ripening of fruit.\nSubstances with a definite inhibiting influence have been isolated, e.g. abscisic acid or dormin shown to inhibit the synthesis of nucleic acid. This hormone was first extracted from cotton bolls where believed responsible for premature abscission, and from maple leaves where believed responsible for winter dormancy of buds.\nThe known growth-promoting phytohormones may be referred to the chemically distinct groups of auxins, gibberellins, and cytokinins, one member of a group having a similar or opposite effect for a specific process to a member of another group, or the two members may be co-operative (synergic), e.g. gibberellin and auxin promote stem elongation (the former with a much stronger effect), and both promote production of parthenocarpic fruit. An auxin inhibits lateral bud development (see apical dominance) while a cytokinin promotes lateral bud development. Cytokinin has been shown to effect formation of callus tissue only in the presence of an auxin. In cereal seed at least, gibberellin has been shown to be formed in the embryo where, under the stimulus of water-intake, it initiates synthesis of enzymes hydrolysing starch and other storage products to soluble form. Auxin (typified by indole acetic acid, IAA) promotes the synthesis of nucleic acid and in the orientation of the young shoot (in the ground) to light, its accumulation in greater amount on the lower side of the stem causing a more rapid cell division on that side which results in a geotropic movement of the shoot to the vertical position.\nIn general, members of each group have similar effects, e.g. the water-soluble, weakly acidic auxins promote cell division within coleoptiles, cambial development, root formation, callusing of tissue, parthenocarpy, and inhibit root elongation and lateral bud development. The synthetic indole butyric acid (IBA), naphthalene acetic acid (NAA), and 2, 4-dichlorophenoxy acid (2, 4-D), have similar effects. Gibberellins (q.v.) effect stem elongation, parthenocarpy, flowering of long-day plants on short-day photoperiods. Originating with kinetin, isolated as a breakdown product (a derivative of adenine) of DNA, the cytokinins also include both naturally-occurring (e.g. zeatin from sweet corn) and synthetic growth-promoters with a general effect on protein synthesis, cell-division, and callusing of tissue.

When sub-marginal and the ovules are few in number, placentation is basal when the ovules are concentrated at the base of the suture, apical when concentrated towards the apex.\nWhen the carpels are united, placentation may be also laminar but when fundamentally sub-marginal, is axile when the carpels are closed and the ovules grouped around a central axis (e.g. a projection of a receptacle) or, when the carpels are united by their margins to form a unilocular ovary, parietal when the ovules are borne on the ovary wall typically in longitudinal rows, free central when free from the wall but on a central axis, and basal when there is no central axis or projection of the placentae. When apical, the ovules are few in number and restricted to, or close to, the 'ceiling' of the locule, often pendulous on long funicles.\nIn relation to the placenta, the orientation of the ovule may be orthotropous when the ovule is erect, its micropyle distal and funicle short or absent, anatropous when turned over (deflexed) at the chalaza and pressed against or adnate with the funicle, the micropyle (usually) facing the placenta, campylotropous when more or less 'n'-shaped, the micropyle facing the placenta to which is attached about mid-way the ovule, amphitropous when the first half of the ovule is adnate with the funicle and the micropyle laterally faces the placenta."

The phytohormones are believed to induce the production of a hormone within the female structure which stimulates the production of fruit. The typical enclosure is an inner wall (intine) of cellulose with a superficial layer of pectin, and an outer wall (extine) usually furrowed (colpate) or pitted, or variously sculptured, composed mainly of sporopollenin, a derivative of a fatty acid with high resistance to water-entry and decay.

It may be linked (conjugate) with a polysaccharide to form a glycoprotein, or associated with a lipid as a lipoprotein, or a nucleic acid as a nucleoprotein. It is in certain cases derivable in crystalline form. It may be soluble or sparingly soluble in water (e.g. albumin, globulin), soluble in 70-80 percent alcohol (protamin), or soluble only in acid or alkali (glutelin). Its solubility in water is a factor of the pH of the solution; when soluble forms an optically-active, electrolytic (by virtue of its component amino acids), colloidal solution.

Of the homosporous pteridophytes, a typically thalloid structure, free-living and autotrophic, developing both antheridia and archegonia, but of other vascular plants shows a progressive degree of reduction.\nThe male prothallus of heterosporous plants typically is represented by one or two prothallial cells developed within and retained by the microspore. It takes no further part in growth, the activity leading to the formation of gametes coming from an antheridial cell of the microspore which develops as an antheridium. It is most reduced in angiosperms, being represented by the very small generative cell and the large tube cell contained by the pollen grain.\nThe female prothallus (except in Salvinia) never is entirely free from the megaspore but from it is developed an archegonium (several archegonia in gymnosperms) within which occurs fertilisation. Of gymnosperms it is a nutritive tissue wholly enclosed by the ovule and persistent within the seed as an endosperm. Of angiosperms, it is reduced to an embryo sac containing eight nuclei."

    {
        "id": 28440,
        "term": "Psilopsid",
        "meaning": "a homosporous pteridophyte, terrestrial but without true roots and leaves, the former represented by hair-like rhizoids arising from a subterranean, dichotomously-branching, mycorrhizal rhizome, the leaves represented by dimorphic lobes. The axis of the shoot is dichotomous, ridged, flattened or thalloid. Sporangia are large and borne on the tips of the larger lobes (considered part of the axis), the spores produced are numerous, simple, in tetrads, on germination developing to small prothalli resembling the rhizome of the sporophyte. The prothallus bears both antheridia and archegonia, the former spherical protuberances within which arise multi-flagellate gametes, the archegonia sunken, with a projecting neck which breaks away at maturity. Among the pteridophytes, the relationship of the psilopsids is with the lycopods, differing from them in the absence of roots and leaves, the position of the sporangia, and the multiflagellate male gametes. The two genera, Psilotum (often xerophytic) and Tmesipteris (often epiphytic) occur in Australia, either in crevices of sandstone cliffs, or as epiphytes of rain-forest.\nAn identical structure has been shown by fossils from the Devonian (e.g. Rhynia, Psilophyton) and the Silurian (Baragwanathia) periods which evidence an aerial photosynthesising system, the stem of Rhynia, the lamina of Baragwanathia. The latter, although from an earlier period, shows leaf-traces and veins. This resemblance, and the fact that the features are not found in other groups indicate that the fossils (collectively the Psilophytales) are linked directly with the psilopsids, hence the extant group may be regarded as the surviving ascendants of the oldest stock of vascular plants. The category of the psilopsid group is generally accepted as a division (Psilopsida) composed of a single order (Psilotales) with a single family Psilotaceae. A second common name for the psilopsid is psilophyte."

        "meaning": "an autotrophic plant predominantly of moist and shaded habitats of warm regions, with an alternation of free-living generations, the sporophyte dominant: a vascular plant (without a cambium except Isoetes), usually a perennial or annual herb (sometimes arborescent) with true roots, or (the psilopsid) without true roots or leaves but with aerial stems, in some (e.g. Azolla) reduced to a simple, moss-like cluster of leaves and free-floating.\nThe sporophyte is either homosporous (a majority) or heterosporous. When homosporous, the asexual spores (reduced to the haploid condition by meiosis from spore mother-cells) germinate to form a small, filamentous or thalloid prothallus, independently living for a short or long time, forming both antheridia and archegonia. When heterosporous, the spores develop either male or female gametophytes with rarely an independent existence from the spore. In both cases, the male gametes are flagellate and require, for fertilisation. water in their transport. Fertilisation leads to the diploid zygote, embryo and development from this of the sporophyte.\nThe classification of the pteridophyte is as a member of one of four divisions Psilophyta (see psilopsid), Lepidophyta (see lycopsid) Calamophyta (see sphenopsid) and Filicophyta (see fern) but in more conservative systems, a common division Pteridophyta is retained for four classes, Psilopsida, Lycopsida, Sphenopsida, Pteropsida. Its phyletic relations are believed to be with the cycadophytes (see under cycad) with a possible derivation through the psilophytes.

Its significance is in the fern-like vegetative features (e.g. the frond-like foliage) and reproductive structures developed on vegetative fronds but with definite forming of seed, thus appearing to bridge the gap between the pteridophytes and gymnosperms. Other seed-bearing fern-like groups subsequently have been established from fossils, e.g. the order Cordaitales, dominant in the Palaeozoic and generally believed the ancestral line of modern conifers."

Usually a commercial timber tree developing a brown to red-coloured durable wood, as well as a valuable honey, shade and shelter tree.\nForest Red Gum Eucalyptus tereticornis traverses some two thousand miles of the eastern coast and appears again in New Guinea. River Red Gum E. camaldulensis is the most widespread of all eucalypts although confined to the mainland. Blakely's Red Gum E. blakelyi and Hill Red Gum E. dealbata are the ubiquitous red gums of the western slopes of New South Wales, the latter sometimes known as Silver Gum because of its ashy-white juvenile leaves (less so with the adult), buds, and smaller branches. Cabbage Gum E. amplifolia, closely allied with Forest Red Gum is a tree of the coast and tablelands adapted to swampy conditions. Another close ally of Forest Red Gum is E. seeana, a commercial timber tree of the coast and sub-coast of northern New South Wales - it is atypical among red gums in its linear to narrowly lanceolate juvenile leaves."

The capacity for regeneration varies inversely with the degree of specialisation, but for vascular plants the principal natural means are restoration, reconstitution and reproductive regeneration.\nRestoration occurs from the activity of meristem adjacent to a wounded surface, e.g. by the development of root or shoot primordia from a callus, as in root-suckering or coppicing.\nReconstitution occurs by the re-organisation either of meristem or mature tissue, e.g. by the rather rare development of meristem below apical meristem to replace the latter when disturbed, or by the re-differentiation of cells close to a wounded surface which reproduce normally for another tissue.\nReproductive regeneration implies the separation of a part and the development from this part, e.g. a stolon, offset, adventitious bud. It is simply vegetative reproduction.\n\nOf a community, the restoration or re-establishment from a disturbed state through the ability of its members to regenerate."

Stored in cells, ducts or cavities within a variety of tissues, sometimes as a component of a latex, or frequently in association with an essential oil, gum, or tannin, the significance to the plant is unknown although a flow may be induced from a wounding.\nA natural resin of commerce often is obtained by simple tapping of incised bark, a few, e.g. Kauri copal and amber, are of fossil origin. Shellac is derived from a secretion of the coccid, the lac insect Tachardia lacca which feeds on the stems of plants chiefly of India.\nWhen semi-solid and containing an appreciable amount of essential oil, resin is termed an oleo-resin, commercially of interest to pharaceutical and histological fields. Included are the turpentines chiefly of Pinus (see under conifer) but including the so-called Canada Balsam from Abies balsamea and Venetian turpentine from Larix decidua. The term balsam refers strictly to resins containing benzoic or cinnamic acid, e.g. Balsam of Peru and Balsam of Tolu from the Central and South American Myroxylon pereirae and M. balsamum (trees of the Papilionaceae) respectively, benzoin and storax from Styrax (Styraceae), storax also from Liquidamber spp. (Hamamelidaceae).\nWhen the resin is in mixture with a true gum to combine the features of both, it is termed a gum-resin. Such names as frankincense, asafoetida and myrrh are familiar to the student of ancient history for their early (and continued) use in perfumes and other preparations and as constituents of incenses of religious rites. Frankincense and myrrh are from Boswellia and Commiphora spp. respectively, trees of the Burseraceae from north-east Africa and south-east Arabia, asafoetida is from Ferula (Umbelliferae) of Persia and Afghanistan.\nWhen solid, brittle, more or less transparent, and with little or no essential oil or gum, the resin of commerce is known as a hard resin with wide applications to the production of varnishes, lacquers, paints, inks, adhesives, plastics,  linoleum etc. although gradually being replaced by synthetic resins (e.g. the phenolic and urea formaldehydes and the acrylics). Familiar examples are:\nThe Australian 'grass tree' or accroid (acaroid) resins exuded at the bases of the leaves of Xanthorrhoea, yellow from X. hastilis, red from X. tateana, australe and others.\nThe copals - resins of relatively high melting point and degree of hardness applicable to varnishes required for external use. Congo copal from trees of Copaifera (Papilionaceae) chiefly in the semi-fossil state: Kauri copal, the fossil resin from the New Zealand Agathis australis.\nThe damars - resins of softer, less durable nature, chiefly from the Dipterocarpaceae of south-east Asia (e.g. the trees of Hopea and Shorea).\nAmber - the fossil resin of the extinct Pinus succinifera of the Baltic regions.\nDragon's Blood - from the rattan palm of east Asia Daemarops draco or species of Dracaena (also of Palmae).\nLacquer - chiefly from the Chinese tree Rhus verniciflua (Anacardiaceae), cultivated in Japan.\nMastic - chiefly from Pistacia lentiscus (Anacardiaceae) of the Mediterranean countries.\nSandarac - from the North African Tetraclinis articulata and the Australian Callitris verrucosa (both of the Cupressaceae)."

        "id": 29820,
        "term": "Respiration",
        "meaning": "the energy-releasing oxidation of biosynthesised products to simpler compounds, the oxidising agent (electron acceptor) being either atmospheric oxygen (aerobic respiration) or other hydrogen acceptor (anaerobic respiration or fermentation), the energy released being available for processes concerning synthesis.\nThe processes proceed in a sequence of oxidation-reduction reactions, each reaction catalytic and requiring some energy for its progress but making available more energy than is absorbed. This is possible through such intermediaries as the co-enzymes nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP), and the energy-carrier adenosine triphosphate (ATP). NAD and NADP have the property of becoming reduced when absorbing energy and readily re-oxidised when releasing energy. ATP is an energy-carrier coupled with oxidative reactions and formed from adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and phosphate. Of concern to aerobic respiration are the cytochromes (q.v.), carriers also of electrons.\nWhen glucose is the substrate and respiration is anaerobic (common to both autotrophic and heterotrophic organisms), an initial stage, glycolysis, involves the splitting of glucose C₆H₁₂O₆ to pyruvic acid CH₃COCOOH. There is a sequence of some nine separate catalytic steps, the pathway known as the Emden-Meyerholf cycle from the two Germans who, in the 1930s, first traced the steps. The over-all reaction may be expressed as:-\n\nglucose + 2NAD + 2ADP + 2 phosphate - 2 pyruvic acid + 2NADH₂ + 2ATP.\n\nFurther anaerobic oxidation (fermentation) yields a number of other products dependent on the enzyme-systems functional in the organism, e.g. lactic acid, ethanol, glycerol, the acids acetic, butyric, citric, gluconic, propionic etc., inorganic substances as nitrates and sulphur, with or without the evolution of carbon dioxide. Alternative pathways to the Emden-Meyerholf have been established.\nAnaerobic respiration is a relatively inefficient process, a large input of substrate being required for a small return of energy, the end-product (when organic) retaining unutilised energy. When oxygen is available as the oxidising agent, a much more efficient process ensues from the pyruvic acid formed by glycolysis. More complex systems of enzymes are required (e.g. cytochromes, oxidases), these being located in the mitochondria of the cell. A number of organic acids (e.g. citric, fumic, malic, succinic) are formed which are intermediates of other metabolic reactions, e.g. the synthesis of amino acids. The sequence of reactions is known as the modified Krebs Tricarboxylic Acid or Citric Acid cycle, and has an over-all result, starting from glucose through glycolysis, which may be expressed as:-\n\nglucose + 28 phosphate + 6O₂ — 6CO₂, + 44H₂0 + 38 ATP.\n\nSee also cytochrome, fermentation, oxidation-reduction, phosphorylation, photosynthesis."

It is readily broken down by the enzyme phosphorylase to glucose phosphate from which it is derived and through the amylase group of enzymes may be converted to maltose, further hydrolysis by maltase leading to glucose (the complete hydrolysis may be duplicated by boiling with dilute acid). Reactant with iodine to give a deep blue colour. Forms a sol with hot water which gels on cooling."

As a noun, a plant adapted to conditions of aridity or salinity by the production of abundant water-storing tissue and a means for reducing transpiration, e.g. development of a heavily cutinised epidermis, by sunken stomates, by the shaping of succulent parts to structures with the least surface to greatest volume, i.e. structures cylindrical, prismatic, spherical.\nWith a reduction of the surface for transpiration, there is consequent reduction of photosynthetic and respiratory activity, and growth-rate. Succulents are perennials often of long life, for some (e.g. Cactaceae, some Euphorbia) a succulent stem (cladode) has taken over the function of the leaf, in others (e.g. Mesembryanthemum, samphires and other chenopodiaceous halophytes), the leaves are succulent, often cylindrical or prismatic and in rosettes from short internodes of the stem."

Where more complex and not readily hydrolysed, is often a catechol or derivative. Both types may be oxidised to coloured phlobaphenes which appear as red or dark-brown pigments of woody tissues and bark (and probably are the dark spots prominent in the leaves of dried essential oil-bearing leaves, e.g. of myrtaceous and rutaceous plants.\nA property of the tanning substance in converting crude hide to stable leather creates a commercial demand. A number of Australian plants are, or have been, commercial sources, e.g. the Wattle Barks chiefly of Acacia mearnsii, A. pycnantha, A. irrorata, Mallet Bark (chiefly Brown Mallet Eucalyptus astringens) and to a more limited extent Mangrove Bark from several native mangroves. Such barks have sufficiently high tannin content to be used directly. Other barks with tannin high in quality but low in content are processed, the extract being the marketable product. Wandoo bark from Eucalyptus wandoo yields a solid extract, myrtan, of high commercial interest. See also under gall."

A fine-textured soil contains much clay and, although lighter in weight per unit volume than sand, is called heavy from its toughness and plasticity in working. Intermediate to these is loam in which both coarse and fine particles are equally represented. Where gravel or silt (silt in the sense of an alluvium of very fine sand) are appreciable, the qualifying 'gravelly' and 'silty' are used.\nIntermediate textures from sand to loam in increasing order of fineness and cohesion conventionally are loamy sand, sandy loam, loam, and from loam to clay, sandy clay loam, clay loam, sandy clay."

In vascular plants the conduction is through tracheids and vessels of xylem. The process is not yet fully clarified, one concept hypothesising a transpiration-cohesion-tension theory. In brief, transpiration from the surface of leaves creates deficits in the diffusion pressure existing in lower regions which, in consequence, draw on the vascular system for water to equilibrate the deficit. Tension, in turn, is created on the elements of xylem which, in equilibrating turgidity, transmit a downward tension effect through the xylem to the root, the cohesive force of water maintaining an upward flow. Roots also exsert a powerful pressure (e.g. as evidenced by the 'bleeding' of stumps) and may aid in the maintenance of an unbroken water column."

Known, as an intracellular parasite, from its effect of controlling the metabolism of its host cell, on which it is completely dependent, to replicate more viral particles with the same potential for cell disorganisation. It is capable of mutating to produce a different, sometimes more virulent strain, and has been likened to a rogue or fragment of genetic material. Has been isolated as a crystal small enough to pass a filter fine enough to arrest bacteria. As a filtrate, is incapable of replication.\nThe virus is transmissible to plants from an infected source which may concern physical contact, grafting, soil, insect vector etc. Its effect may be a mosaic disease, e.g. the mosaic disease of the tobacco plant, dwarfing or other malformation, or be limited to a sometimes horticulturally desirable variegated or striped condition of leaf or flower.\nAs a pathogen of mammals, the importance of the virus is great. It is the causative of the common cold, influenza, chicken pox and shingles, measles and mumps, viral hepatitis, small pox, rabies etc., myxamytosis of rabbits, foot and mouth disease of cattle, swine fever etc. See also bacteriophage, and bacterium (Rickettsiales)."

While sometimes displaying the 'chemical messenger' effect typical of phytohormones (q.v.), e.g. thiamine and nicotinic acid, synthesised in leaf promoting growth of roots, usually is not translocated to operational sites but operates in the region of its synthesis.\nThe derivation of the name (vita, life; aminose, of an amine) from an early belief that the 'essential to life' substance was an amino derivative, and its original definition have come from the biochemistry of animals whose complete dependence on the vitamin is well known. An absence causes disease,  avitaminoses, in both animal and plant.\nWhile the chemical structure of the vitamin is diverse, it is customary to refer to it as either water-soluble or fat-soluble. The fat-soluble Vitamin A, and Vitamin D (calciferol) are known in plants only by their precursors (provitamins) carotenes and sterenes respectively. Vitamin E (tocopherol), and Vitamin K (1, 4-naphthoquinone acetate) are believed associated with chlorophyll-production.\nThe water-soluble vitamins include thiamine (Vitamin B₁), riboflavin (B₂), nicotinic acid amide (niacin), pantothenic acid (pantothen), pyridoxine (B₆), biotin (H), inositol, ascorbic acid (C), citrine (P)."

        "term": "Wood",
        "meaning": "secondary xylem formed from a vascular cambium, composed of an axial system of cells and a radial system of cells. The cells of the axial system principally are of tracheary elements functioning for water-conduction, fibres for support, and parenchyma. Cells of the radial, or ray, system chiefly are of parenchyma and function for storage and translocation of various solutes.\nWith increase in age, cells of these systems become blocked by, e.g. resins, tannins, kinos or reconverted storage materials, tyloses (q.v.) may block vessels, tori (see torus) may block pits of tracheids. The effect is a cessation of function and frequent darkening of the zone. This zone is the heartwood. The outer peripheral often lighter-coloured zone of functional cells, the sapwood, is variable in extent, sometimes extensive but, as in a majority of eucalypts, may be limited to a narrow periphery.\nAccording to its origin, wood is termed softwood when from conifers where the typical tracheary element is a tracheid, (hence the wood known also as non-pored), and hardwood when from angiosperms where the vessel is the element (the wood known also as pored). In Australia, where the major hardwood is provided by the eucalypt, heartwood is divisible to two parts, an inner brittle core known as 'heart', and 'truewood' which is the utilisable part for timber. The sapwood, although susceptible to wood-boring larvae (e.g. Lyctus brunneus) from its storage of starch, varies little in mechanical strength from the heartwood and has the advantage, in the conversion of wood to timber, of providing a penetrable surface for wood preservatives to which the truewood is resistant. From Anglo-Saxon wudu. See also Growth Ring."

This is an open community in which single- or multi-stemmed evergreen sclerophyllous trees are scattered, a herbaceous stratum when developed is dependent largely on season, and a sclerophyllous shrub stratum is well-developed, e.g. the Scribbly Gum (E. racemosa, or E. haemastoma) — heath association of coastal New South Wales."
